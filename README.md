# USAA Fraud News Intelligence Pipeline
A Python + Streamlit system for scraping, summarizing, embedding, and querying fraud-related news articles for USAA Fraud Intelligence teams.

## 1. 📌 Project Overview
This class project invites UNC Charlotte students to develop Python-based tools capable of:
* Scraping fraud/scam-related news articles
* Cleaning and extracting key fraud-related information
* Generating AI summaries
* Embedding article text into a vector database (Supabase)
* Serving a Streamlit RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) App
* Enabling fraud analysts to ask natural-language questions like:
    “What fraud trends emerged this week?”
    “What scams are most common in banking?”
* USAA uses these insights to support:
* State of Fraud Quarterly Reports
* Weekly fraud intelligence updates
* Executive briefings

This repo contains the complete pipeline + a working Streamlit UI.
