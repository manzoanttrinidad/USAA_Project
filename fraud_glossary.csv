Term,Definition
1st Party Fraud,"First Party Fraud is a form of financial crime committed by someone who has an authorized relationship with an institution, such as a bank. In these cases, the fraud is perpetrated by the person with legitimate access to the system or services in question. Examples of 1st Party Fraud include using a stolen credit card, writing unauthorized checks, and using credentials to initiate wire transfers. These scenarios are difficult to prevent given the legitimate access of the perpetrator. Banks must use both active measures, such as fraud detection tools, as well as passive measures, such as limiting the amount of money that can be transferred without additional approval, to protect both their customers and their systems."
3DS (3D Secure),"Three-D Secure (3DS) is an added layer of security used in online credit and debit card transactions that requires a two or three-step authentication process to verify and validate the cardholder's identity. This authentication consists of a combination of the cardholder's information—such as the cardholder's billing address, the cardholder's card number, the cardholder's CVV2 code, and other data stored in the credit and debit card networks—as well as OTP (One-Time Password) sent to the cardholder's registered mobile device. This means that there is an extra step for customers to take before transactions are processed—in almost all cases, this helps to reduce the chance of fraudulent activities since it helps ensure the cardholder's identity is truly verified. The 3DS system also offers a greater level of payment security for merchants since the extra layer of authentication can help to reduce fraud, which in turn reduces chargebacks associated with fraudulent payments."
3rd Party Fraud,"Third-party fraud is when an outside party, not the actual account holder of a financial or other sensitive institution, uses the account holder's personal information to commit fraud. This can happen through the theft of data, skimming, or other nefarious methods. The fraudster could use the stolen data to access and use the account illegally, make purchases with the account, or even present fraudulent documentation to open a new account. Other variations of third-party fraud may involve false identities, which is when a scam artist takes over someone’s identity to open up credit accounts or commit other fraud. In any of these cases, the account holder may be the unknowing victim of a more experienced fraudster."
419 Fraud,"419 Fraud is a type of scam that takes the form of an email, fax, or letter from a fictitious individual or organisation claiming to have access to unclaimed funds or inheritances. The so-called funds require the recipient to pay some kind of advance fee or commission to facilitate the release of the funds or inheritance. Recipients are often asked to consult a lawyer or money transfer service who will process the transaction on their behalf. Unfortunately, these funds and inheritances don't exist and the money sent is gone forever. This form of fraud is especially insidious because the large sums of money promised can often be sensible investments that victims cannot resist. Victims should be suspicious of such messages, especially if large sums of money are promised for seemingly no commitment."
A/B testing,"A/B Testing is an effective method for measuring the success of an online marketing campaign or website design. A/B Testing works by dividing users into two groups, with each group being exposed to a different version of the page, design or message. The results from each group are then compared to determine which version is more successful. Since users are exposed to different versions, A/B Testing allows marketers to identify which versions are more effective, and tailor their marketing initiatives accordingly. A/B Testing is a powerful way to measure the performance of a website, various design elements, and marketing campaigns. Therefore, it can be used to increase conversions and optimize user experience."
Access Control,"Access control is a security measure designed to protect against unauthorized access to a system, its data, and/or its resources. It is typically made up of a combination of authentication, authorization, and auditing. Authentication is the process of verifying that a user is who they say they are, typically via a username and password. Authorization is the process of granting users access to the systems, data, and/or resources based on their authentication. Auditing is the process of gathering information about who is using the system and what they are doing while they use the system. Access control measures ensure the security of the system and its data, by limiting the access and activities of users with only the necessary permissions."
Access Control List (ACL),"An Access Control List (ACL) is a collection of rules and restrictions used to define a security policy for a system or network. An ACL is typically associated with a set of users and/or resources, with each rule granting users access to specific resources and operations. The ACLs define the levels of access that a user has and what group permissions they may have. ACLs are typically implemented at the application, network and operating system level and dictate the specific levels of access that a user has; such as read, write, delete or execute access. ACLs are important security tools as they help protect networks and data from unauthorized access and can help enforce appropriate user access controls."
Access Control Service,"Access control service is an important security system that enables an organization to manage access to its data and other digital resources. It is typically used by an administrator to create, view, and manage user access rights for specific applications or systems. Generally, access control service enables organizations to control who has access to their systems and when access is granted or denied. It also allows organizations to set up access levels that regulate who can access their data and assets. Additionally, access control services provide a variety of security mechanisms such as authentication, authorization, and encryption to ensure that only authorized users have access to data and resources. Through the use of access control service, organizations can protect their data and assets from unauthorized access, thus boosting their data security."
Access Management Access,"management is the process of managing and controlling user access to systems and data, typically through granting and revoking permissions. Access management includes identifying, authenticating and authorizing users as well as monitoring, logging and auditing user activity to ensure compliance with security policies. Access management also includes regularly patching and updating systems and software, using two-factor authentication and providing appropriate security training across an organization. By implementing these procedures, businesses can ensure the secure management of internal and external user access to the company’s communications, networks and systems."
Access Matrix,"Access matrix is a security model used to categorize and describe how users interact with resources in a system; it provides the foundation for access control and authorization decisions. The matrix defines all entities in the system, such as users and resources, and allows for the creation of permissions that regulate how users can interact with a particular resource. An access matrix contains individual entries for each user in the system. Each entry consists of a row and column that contains the user's set of permissions for a specific resource. By utilizing an access matrix, a system administrator can quickly determine who has access to a resource and what the level of access is for that user. The matrix is also used to track changes to user access, audit trails, and log who has access and when. This gives valuable insight into user activity and security events."
Account Harvesting,"Account Harvesting is an attack technique where an attacker attempts to gain access to a user's accounts on different web services by obtaining their login credentials or other private information. This can be done by using various methods, such as phishing, spoofing, brute force attacks, and credential stuffing. An attacker may target multiple accounts at once, and often times, a user's account information is acquired from one source and then used to try to gain access to other accounts. This type of attack is common on social media and other websites, as it can be done without requiring physical access to a device. As such, it requires vigilance on the part of users to protect their accounts from this type of attack. Additionally, organizations and businesses need to employ tools and measures to protect their systems from account harvesting attacks."
Account Takeover Fraud (ATO),"Account Takeover Fraud (ATO) is a type of fraud that occurs when an attacker gains access to and takes control of an account that belongs to another person. This type of fraud is also known as identity theft. The attacker can use the account to transfer funds, make fraudulent purchases, or use the data stored within the account to gain access to other accounts. ATO fraud can occur online, since attackers can use stolen login credentials to gain access to an account, or offline, when attackers may have physical access to the account holder's information. The best way to protect yourself from ATO fraud is to use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and regularly monitor your accounts for any signs of unauthorized access."
Ack Piggybacking,"ACK Piggybacking is a form of message optimization performed in Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). It is a technique used to reduce the number of packet transmissions between two nodes. It involves the sending of an acknowledgment (ACK) packet along with new data, thereby piggybacking the acknowledgements on the data packet. This reduces the need for additional acknowledgements, allowing for faster and more efficient communications. For example if a node requires acknowledgment for all packets sent, it would need to send a dedicated ACK packet for each packet sent, thus doubling the number of transmissions. ACK Piggybacking however allows it to respond with a single packet containing both the new data and the ACK, reducing the number of transmissions and increasing transmission speed."
Acquirer (Acquiring Bank),"An Acquirer (also known as an Acquiring Bank) is a financial institution that processes credit or debit card payments on behalf of a merchant. Acquirers verify customer information and merchant services such as merchant accounts. Once they have authorized a transaction, they transfer the payment to the merchant’s bank account or credit the customer’s account. Acquirers are also responsible for verifying transaction security and preventing fraud. They protect their banks and customers by taking steps such as monitoring customer accounts, scanning for unusual behavior, and looking for suspicious transactions. Acquirers use technology such as encryption and tokenization to safeguard customer data. Acquirers also maintain relationships with card issuers such as Visa and Mastercard to ensure transactions are handled properly."
Active Authentication,"Active Authentication is a type of authentication that utilizes additional layers of security beyond username and password. These layers of security can include biometrics, two-factor authentication (2FA), or identity verification involving additional forms of unique identification. It is an important security measure for online businesses and digital applications, as it helps to ensure the authenticity of users. Active Authentication helps protect the user and the service provider from potential fraudulent activities, such as unauthorized access of user accounts, identity theft and data breaches."
Activity Monitors,"Activity monitors are tools used by cybersecurity experts to detect suspicious behavior on a system. They are used to detect, log, and alert on any activity that is deemed out of the ordinary. Activity monitors work by collecting data from network traffic and log files to detect unusual activity. They may include the use of traffic analysis, machine learning algorithms, and anomaly detection techniques to detect malicious activity and alert security teams of any potential intrusions. Activity monitors are invaluable to any cybersecurity professional as they can help identify and prevent malicious actors from entering a system and conducting malicious activities."
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP),"Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a networking protocol used to map a physical address, such as a MAC address, to an IP address. ARP is a critical part of network communication, enabling devices to access the network by sending a broadcast message containing the MAC address of the target device. The target device then responds with its MAC address, thus allowing the two devices to establish communication. As a critical part of network operation, securing ARP is a key step for any Cybersecurity Expert in order to ensure the safety of the network from malicious actors. ARP spoofing, an attack where attackers substitute their own MAC address for the target device, is one of the biggest threats that can be mitigated by implementing proper security protocols."
Administrative Account,"Administrative accounts are a type of user account that provides users with full access and control over a computer system or network. These accounts are essentially superuser accounts that allow authorized users to make system-wide changes, create and modify user accounts, view, modify and delete files, and configure system settings. Administrative accounts are designed to be used in secured environments and are typically protected with strong passwords and two-factor authentication. As the name suggests, the administrative accounts should only be used by those with the appropriate permissions and privileges in order to prevent malicious access and attacks."
Advance-Fee Fraud,"Advance-Fee Fraud is a type of financial scam, wherein the perpetrator requests personal information and requests a fee (usually of a large amount) to be paid up front before they can process a loan, inheritance, lottery winnings or otherwise obtain monetary gain. It should be noted that this fee is often non-refundable. This type of fraud preys on people with limited resources or low level of financial literacy. It often makes use of false identities, contact details, and fake documents in order to gain a victim's trust. Victims are usually approached via emails, phone calls or even via social media. It can be difficult to identify this fraud as perpetrators have become adept at disguising their schemes, but common signs include requests for payment or for personal information such as bank accounts or credit card numbers."
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES),"Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is an encryption algorithm used to protect sensitive data, such as passwords and files, from unauthorized access. AES uses symmetric-key cryptography, meaning the same key is used to both encrypt and decrypt the data. AES has been adopted by the U.S. government and is used worldwide for encryption. AES is a strong, secure algorithm that provides a high level of protection for sensitive data, as it uses a 128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit data encryption key. This makes it nearly impossible for unauthorized individuals to access the data, as it is highly unlikely that they would be able to guess the key. Furthermore, AES is immune to brute force attacks, making it one of the most secure encryption methods available."
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT),"Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) are sophisticated cyber threats launched by a malicious actor (attacker) aiming to gain or maintain access to target network systems over a prolonged period of time. APTs are usually characterized by the lack of initial awareness of the attacker’s presence, the ability to quickly adapt to a changing environment, and the development of advanced tactics and techniques in order to remain hidden on the target system and successfully carry out the attack. Common elements of APT include attacking multiple points of a network, use of encrypted communication channels, and the use of a variety of techniques such as social engineering, malicious software, and data exfiltration. APTs are highly organized, complex, and difficult to detect and respond to. Taking these threats seriously and acting upon them is essential for an organization to successfully protect itself from falling victim to an APT attack."

Electronic Money (E-Money),"Electronic Money, or E-Money, is a digital form of currency stored in electronic wallets and used for online purchases. E-Money does not exist as a physical object, and its value is determined by the issuing institution. This type of digital currency is typically used for online purchases and can be used to purchase goods and services or transfer money between accounts. E-Money is becoming increasingly popular as an alternative to traditional payment methods, as it is convenient and relatively secure. However, its use must be monitored closely to ensure it is not being used to facilitate illicit activities such as money laundering."
Electronic Verification (EV),"Electronic Verification (EV) is the process of verifying a person's identity, address and other data through electronic means. This process typically involves evaluating an individual's identity and address against public and private databases. EV may also include data checks on money laundering indicators such as a person's financial history, social security number, tax identification number, passport number or driver's license number. EV is an important tool for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and customer due diligence (CDD) programs to help ensure a customer's identity is valid and up-to-date."
Email Fraud,"Email fraud is a type of online crime that involves the use of deceptive tactics to try to get someone to provide sensitive personal information via email. The most common form of email fraud is phishing, in which a criminal attempts to gather personal or financial information by sending emails that appear to come from a legitimate source, such as a bank or credit card issuer. The emails typically prompt the recipient to click a link that takes them to a counterfeit website where they are asked to provide information such as passwords, PIN numbers, or credit card numbers. Email fraudsters also use tactics such as attachment scams, in which an innocent-looking file attached to an email contains malicious code, or hijacked accounts, in which a user is tricked into providing their account credentials. The best way to protect against email fraud is to use an anti-virus program and be wary of any emails that ask for personal information."
Email Security,"Email security is a set of practices and protocols used to protect email messages and content from unauthorized access, modification, or deletion. It seeks to protect users from spam, phishing, malware, and other malicious activity, as well as protect data stored on email servers from hackers and other malicious actors. Email security protocols include using secure connections (such as SSL/TLS), encrypting messages, implementing multifactor authentication, regularly updating software and hardware, preventing unauthorized access with firewalls and user authentication, and monitoring email traffic. All of these measures help protect users from cyber attacks and promote safe and secure email communication."
Email Spam,"Email Spam is unwanted emails sent in bulk, typically sent by automated programs. These emails are often sent out with no specific target in mind, instead hoping to attract anyone foolish enough to click on their malicious links. The emails can contain phishing scams, malicious software, and links to malware sites, all of which can lead to serious financial losses or even identity theft. Spam emails also create a greater chance of users' emails getting compromised, stealing personal information and furthering the reach of cyber criminals. It's important to keep email security up to date and to be wary of any emails that seem too good to be true. Be mindful not to click any suspicious links to avoid becoming a victim of email spam."
Email Tumbling,"Email tumbling is a type of phishing attack that involves hijacking an email. It works by the attacker using an email address registered or purchased from a spoofing service, and ""tumbling"" it with a list of other legitimate email account addresses. The hijacked email is made to appear to have originated from an actual, reputable source. In certain cases, an email tumbling attack will take place in combination with other social engineering tactics, such as ransomware or Trojan infections, and aims at stealing user data by convincing the users to reveal their security credentials. An email tumbling attack can leave users vulnerable to exploitation and financial loss."
Email Verification,"Email Verification, also known as Email Validation, is a process of verifying and validating the authenticity of an email address that is provided by a user. Generally, this process involves checking the syntax of the email address, authenticity of the domain and whether or not the mailbox exists. To verify an email address, tools such as SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) validation and third-party verification systems can be used to confirm the details of a user's email address. It's important to validate emails as it ensures that only real addresses are used, reducing the chances of a fraudulent, malicious or robotic account being created. Email verification is also a key component of data hygiene, and can enable an organization to remove any emails associated with malicious activity from their lists."
Embargo,"An embargo is a legal or economic order imposed by a government on the import, export, or transfer of goods, services, or capital to or from another country. It is generally used to protect a nation's economy, or to punish another country for political reasons. An embargo prohibits entities from engaging in commercial activities with an embargoed country, including trade, investment and financial transactions. It also restricts the transfer of technology, the provision of services and funds, the acquisition of goods, or any other economic or financial activities with or involving the embargoed country. Embargoes are a powerful tool that can be used to disrupt the economic relationships between countries, which can lead to serious political, economic and social consequences for the affected countries involved."
Embezzlement,"Embezzlement is the illegal misappropriation of funds or assets entrusted to an individual or organization. It is a form of white-collar crime and is often committed by individuals in a fiduciary role, such as a corporate executive, accountant, or employee. The act of embezzlement involves fraudulently converting the entrusted property for one's own gain, either through outright theft, or by diverting funds for an unauthorized use. As an Anti-Money Laundering expert, one must be aware of the signs of embezzlement and alert their employer to any suspicious activity that could involve the misappropriation of funds."
Employment Scam,"Employment scam is a type of fraud where criminals target job seekers. It usually involves criminals pretending to be legitimate employers, often through phony websites and email accounts. In these scams, the scammers may offer jobs that either do not exist or require the job seeker to pay upfront in order to obtain the “employment”. They may then ask for the person’s personal and bank details which can lead to identity theft or financial losses. Additionally, the “employers” are often very persuasive in convincing job seekers that the opportunity is legitimate and urge individuals to act quickly. It is important for job seekers to confirm the legitimacy of the job and the employer before providing any sort of personal information."
EMV,"EMV stands forEuropay, MasterCard, and Visa. It is a global standard for credit cards equipped with computer chips and the technology used to authenticate chip-card transactions. EMV cards are characterized by their small embedded microprocessors or chips, which store and protect cardholder data. The chips also enable sophisticated fraud prevention features, such as dynamic card verification values (CVV), dynamic data authentication (DDA), and transaction-specific cryptograms. To complete an EMV transaction, the card's chip must be read by an EMV-compatible device and users must authenticate the transaction using a PIN or signature. EMV cards and the EMV standard help to reduce card-fraud and create a more secure payment environment for merchants and customers alike."
Encapsulation,"Encapsulation is a security mechanism that is used to protect data and information from undesired access and manipulation. It works by creating an additional layer of protection around the data and information, commonly referred to as a wrapper. This prevents hackers from directly accessing the data as the wrapper must be broken for access. In addition, the wrapper also provides a boundary for the data, restricting access to only authorized users. Encapsulation is one of the core principles of cybersecurity, as it prevents any form of unauthorized access from taking place and ensures that the data is kept safe and secure."
Encode,"Encode is a process used to transform data from one format to another. This process helps secure data by making it difficult for attackers to understand, allowing only those with the right decoding tools and knowledge to access the data. The most common type of encoding is encryption, which uses complex algorithms to convert plain text into an encrypted cipher. Other types of encoding include hashing and encoding into different formats, such as HTML, JSON or Base64. Encoding is an essential tool for cybersecurity professionals to protect data from unauthorized access."
Encryption,"Encryption is a process of encoding a message or data in such a way that only the intended recipient can decode it. Encryption is an important cybersecurity tool to protect data from unauthorized access, modification, and/or use. It works by transforming plain text into a ciphertext by applying an encryption algorithm and a secret key. The ciphertext cannot be decrypted without the secret key and is therefore unreadable by anyone other than the intended recipient. This makes encryption an important cybersecurity measure to protect data in storage, transit, and communication."
Encryption Key,"Encryption keys are a type of security measure used to protect data from unauthorized access. They are used to encrypt data for storage and transmission in order to keep it secure. An encryption key is a string of random numbers, letters and/or symbols used to scramble data so that only those with the encryption key can decode it. Encryption keys can be either symmetric (where the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data) or asymmetric (where different keys are used for each function). Encryption keys are an effective way to protect sensitive data from malicious third-parties. It is important for organizations to regularly update their encryption keys to make sure their data remains as secure as possible."
End-User Certificate,"An End-User Certificate is a type of certificate issued by a Certification Authority (CA) to an individual or an organization. The certificate is used to authenticate the identity of the end-user and validate that the user has permission to access financial systems and data, and to prove that the user is the person the Certificate was issued to. The Certificate contains the user's name, email address, public key, and other information related to the end-user. When used with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) software, the End-User Certificate helps to identify, monitor, and report money laundering activities."
Endpoint Detection And Response (EDR),"Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is an advanced cybersecurity technology used to detect and respond to malicious activity. It acts as a supplement to traditional security solutions providing a comprehensive real-time view of an organization’s environment. EDR uses machine learning, behavior analytics and automation to identify potential threats and respond to them quickly and efficiently. It monitors each endpoint for suspicious activity and provides visibility into the entire system's activities and audit trails. In addition, EDR offers the ability to detect and stop suspicious activities before they can cause damage. EDR is an essential tool for any organization to secure its data and resources from malicious actors."
Endpoint Protection,"Endpoint protection is a type of cybersecurity solution that uses a variety of techniques to protect endpoints from malicious software and other cyber threats. Endpoints can be any type of device such as laptops, tablets, mobile phones, desktops, or servers connected to a network. Endpoint protection includes measures such as firewalls and antivirus/malware detection and removal programs to detect, contain, and block threats as well as patch management to ensure the security of the system is up to date. It can also include tracking, backup, and restore capabilities to allow organizations to quickly recover from any security incidents. Endpoint protection is often layered with other types of security solutions such as network security, data encryption and user authentication. Together, these measures provide comprehensive security for all of the organization’s endpoints."
Endpoint Security,"Endpoint security, also known as endpoint protection, is a type of security system designed to protect the data, applications, and personal information stored on a user's personal device. It is an important part of any modern organization's security strategy, and is designed to protect the end-user from malware, ransomware, and other internet threats. Endpoint security involves the deployment of agent-based software on each device in order to detect any suspicious activity. It also incorporates firewall, antivirus, and other security tools to protect the user from malicious external threats. Additionally, it can be used to monitor user behavior and detect any suspicious activities, which allows organizations to quickly respond and take necessary corrective action."
Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD),"Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) is a process of rigorous monitoring of a customer relationship to ensure that the customer is not involved in any money laundering and finance crimes. EDD normally involves deeper scrutiny of the customer's sources of funds and their identity to ensure that all activities meet acceptable standards. EDD is an integral part of Anti Money Laundering compliance and is regularly used in on-boarding new customers. EDD requires the financial institution to verify the customer's identity, analyze their risk profiles and investigate their backgrounds to identify any suspicious activity. EDD also includes ongoing monitoring for any changes or activity that could pose a higher risk or indicate a potential for money laundering."
Escrow Passwords,"Escrow passwords are a security system for managing a user's passwords. They are used by organizations or companies when an individual needs to be given access to multiple accounts but cannot remember or manage all the passwords. Escrow passwords allow a single user to authorize access to multiple accounts without having to remember the individual passwords. The authorized user would typically provide the escrow system with their username, password, and account access details. The escrow system will then securely store the credentials and send them to the appropriate account holder when requested. In this way, the individual no longer needs to remember the passwords of all the accounts, but still needs to remember the username and password of the escrow system. This provides secure access while also ensuring the user's privacy."
Eurasian Group On Combating Money Laundering And Financing Of Terrorism (EAG),"The Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (EAG) is a regional organization that is responsible for promoting and facilitating the implementation of international standards of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing across the Eurasian region.

The regulation applies to all OTC derivatives, exchange-traded derivatives, and centrally cleared derivatives including all relevant financial counterparties, such as investment firms, credit institutions, and non-financial entities. EMIR requires firms to meet the requirements of trade reporting, risk mitigation, and the clearing of derivatives. In addition, EMIR requires the use of an approved reporting mechanism (ARM) to submit reports to a trade repository, as well as risk mitigation measures, such as collateralization of derivatives. EMIR’s purpose is to provide better protection to the financial system by reducing counterparty risk and improving the transparency of the derivatives market."
European Union Directive On Prevention Of The Use Of The Financial System For The Purpose Of Money Laundering And Terrorist Financing,"The European Union Directive on Prevention of the Use of the Financial System for the Purpose of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing, commonly referred to as the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (4AMLD), is an EU legislation that aims to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing activities. More specifically, it requires financial institutions to carry out enhanced customer due diligence, implement internal control mechanisms, and report suspicions of money laundering or terrorist financing activities. It also introduces a new set of regulations to improve the effectiveness of the fight against money laundering, such as the mandatory registration of corporate and trust beneficial owners in a publically accessible register. 4AMLD also makes it easier for the exchange of information between financial institutions and law enforcement authorities."
Europol,"Europol is the European Union’s law enforcement agency, tasked with tackling serious international crime and terrorism. Specifically, Europol focuses on combating money laundering, a criminal activity that hides the origins of illicitly-gained money. Anti-money laundering experts use a variety of strategies to detect, prevent, and investigate suspicious activity. These include analyzing financial data, monitoring transactions, and tracking the flow of funds across borders. Europol takes an active role in these initiatives and works with law enforcement agencies throughout the EU to ensure that criminals do not use financial systems to hide and transfer illegal proceeds."
Evasion,"Evasion of Economic Sanctions is a type of financial crime which involves deliberately circumventing international economic restrictions imposed by governments. This could involve activities such as establishing sham companies and creating false trade documents to cover up the real beneficiary of illicit funds, or using false shipping documents to disguise the destination of the goods, as well as using underground banking networks to transfer funds to sanctioned countries or individuals. All of these activities are intended to help those subject to sanctions to gain access to goods or services that would not otherwise be available, or evade restrictions on money transfers. It is a serious crime, with severe penalties in many countries."
Event-Triggered Monitoring,"Event-triggered monitoring is a method of analyzing financial transactions to identify suspicious activity. It uses various parameters, such as the amount, type, and source of funds, to identify suspicious events. This method is used to detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, or other criminal activities. It allows for the prompt identification of suspicious transactions which could potentially involve money laundering or other criminal activities. Event-triggered monitoring helps financial institutions comply with anti-money laundering laws and ensures that they are aware of any suspicious activity. This method also helps identify previously unknown money laundering activities."
Exclusions List,"An Exclusions List is a tool utilized by anti-money laundering experts to help identify and isolate suspicious financial transactions. The list includes entities and individuals that are prohibited from conducting business with the organization due to their potential involvement in money laundering activities. This list can contain names of past customers, high-risk countries, and entities that have been previously identified by government or other regulatory bodies as being associated with money laundering. The Exclusions List also helps to ensure that the organization is not exposed to legal and financial liabilities related to money laundering."
Exploit,"An exploit is a type of malicious software used by attackers to take advantage of vulnerabilities in a computer system or program. It is designed to gain unauthorized access to a system, compromise its security, and allow the attacker to control it or obtain sensitive data.Exploits are usually written in a scripting language, such as JavaScript, and can be distributed in a variety of ways such as through email attachments, malicious links, and malicious websites. They can be used to remotely control systems, gain access to sensitive data, and even to launch damaging attacks such as a denial of service. As such, they are a major threat to any system and need to be addressed and monitored."
Exponential Backoff Algorithm,"The Exponential Backoff Algorithm is a method for retrying an operation a set number of times which increases the wait time between retries exponentially. It is commonly used in computer networks, and is a part of the Transport Control Protocol. The algorithm works by increasing the time to wait for each retry, enabling the system to recover more quickly from high levels of contention. Exponential Backoff enables distributed systems to have a better chance at successful operation, by reducing the amount of simultaneous attempts by multiple users or processes which can overload the system. The algorithm also helps to reduce the probability of retry attempts overlapping, causing conflicts or data integrity issues. This makes it an effective tool to optimize network performance, ensuring a steady flow of communication and data exchange."
Export Administration Regulations (EAR),"The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) are a set of regulations created by the U.S. Department of Commerce that are aimed at preventing the illegal export of U.S. items and services. These regulations primarily focus on restricting the transfer of potentially dangerous items and technologies to certain countries and individuals deemed as a national security threat. The EAR regulates the export of items from the United States and the release of certain technologies and software to foreign nationals within the United States. Additionally, the EAR requires that parties receiving any U.S. items or services comply with applicable regulations concerning anti-money laundering and financing of terrorism."
Export Control Joint Unit (ECJU),"Export Control Joint Unit (ECJU) is a collaborative organisation between HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) and the Department for International Trade (DIT) of the United Kingdom government. The unit is responsible for the enforcement of strategic controls over the export of goods from the UK. This includes implementation of export control regulations, monitoring of exports and the identification of illegal activities related to export controls. The ECJU utilises intelligence and risk-based approaches to enforce compliance with export controls. It also works with industry to ensure the UK's trade controls are effective, and with law enforcement agencies to combat illicit trade."
Exposure,"Exposure is a concept in cybersecurity that refers to the fact that an organization or individual is vulnerable to potential threats and risks. Exposure can take many forms, ranging from the disclosure of sensitive data, to an organization's lack of security controls or procedures, to the lack of appropriate infrastructure and technology to protect the organization from attack. Exposure can also refer to the amount of resources and knowledge that an organization or individual has to prevent and respond to cyber threats. Even though organizations can take measures to protect themselves, exposure can still exist, making it key for organizations to invest in credible cybersecurity strategies and solutions."
Express Trust,"A trust is an arrangement in which a person or entity (known as the trustor/settlor) transfers legal ownership of his/her property to another person or entity (known as the trustee) for the benefit of a third party (known as the beneficiary). An express trust is an arrangement where the trustor explicitly states the trust's terms and conditions in a written document that is signed and witnessed. The trustee must follow the terms and conditions of the trust document, and is responsible for managing the trust assets for the benefit of the beneficiary. An express trust is a valuable tool to protect and manage assets, especially for anti-money laundering."
Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP),"The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is an authentication framework used in point-to-point connections that provides support for multiple authentication methods. It is used to authenticate users of a variety of networks, such as wireless, LAN, and VPNs, by using an encrypted exchange of information between the client and the authentication server. EAP provides flexibility for allowing different authentication methods such as smart cards, one-time passwords, Kerberos, and public key certificates. It also provides support for multiple authentication rounds to enhance the strength of the authentication process. Additionally, EAP supports mutual authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and session resumption for better performance and user experience."
Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP),"Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) is a type of protocol used in networking to exchange routing information between two autonomous systems. Specifically, EGP is a protocol that exists at the top of the internet protocol (IP) suite hierarchy and is used for connecting two different networks. It allows for communication between two systems, such as different organizations, that have different routing capabilities, and protocols, such as RIP, OSPF and ISIS. In essence, EGP provides a way for networks to communicate and exchange data, while ensuring that all data transferred is secure and accurate. Therefore, it is an important part of any network’s security architecture and can provide defence against any unauthorized access or data manipulation."
External Evasion,"External Evasion is an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) technique used by criminals to move illicit funds out of a jurisdiction. It entails the transfer of funds or assets across borders or to another financial institution outside the jurisdiction. External Evasion is often disguised as legitimate business transactions for the purpose of concealing the true source of the funds. This can be accomplished through activities such as shell companies, false invoicing, offshore accounts, and trade-based money laundering. As an Anti-Money Laundering Expert it is essential to stay informed and monitor changing methods used to commit this type of fraud."
Extradition,"Extradition is the legal process whereby an individual who is accused or convicted of a crime in one jurisdiction (the defendant) is surrendered by another jurisdiction (the requested state) to the requesting jurisdiction. This can occur between two different countries, or between federal and state jurisdictions within the same country. Extradition proceedings are governed by domestic statutes, as well as by international treaties between states for the purpose of criminal law enforcement. Extradition requests are made by the prosecuting authority on behalf of the requesting jurisdiction. Courts in the requested state can determine whether the defendant is lawfully extraditable."
Extraterritorial Jurisdiction,"Extraterritorial jurisdiction is a legal term that refers to a country's power to enforce its laws beyond its borders. This is typically accomplished by extending the jurisdiction of a domestic court to an offense committed by a foreign national in a foreign country. This type of power is typically used in cases where a foreign national has committed a crime, such as money laundering, in another country, and the country wishes to prosecute them. Extraterritorial jurisdiction can also be used to protect a foreign national's rights when they are in a foreign country."
Extraterritorial Reach,"Extraterritorial Reach is a concept used in Anti-Money Laundering law that allows a government to extend the scope of its laws to entities located outside its jurisdiction. The purpose of this concept is to prevent money laundering and other financial crimes, allowing the government to reach transactions that occur in foreign jurisdictions. This allows a country to effectively police its borders, pursuing criminals and enforcing its laws, even when they are outside the country. This can be done through judicial assistance and cooperative agreements negotiated between countries."
Facial Recognition,"Facial recognition is a form of biometric identification that uses an individual's physical characteristics such as facial features, shape, and structure, to recognize them for security purposes. Data from an individual face is captured through various sensors that analyze physical characteristics, such as the distance between eyes, size of the nose, and shape of the chin. The data is then compared to a vast database to match against known identities. It is commonly used for identification, access control, and surveillance in high-security areas and to increase the accuracy of fraud prevention and cyber security measures."
Facilitation,"Facilitation of money laundering refers to the process of assisting individuals or organizations in hiding illegal sources of wealth or income. This activity is aimed at deceiving law enforcement and avoiding taxes. Facilitation of money laundering can involve the use of intermediaries or shell companies to transfer funds, providing false documents to disguise the true origin of funds, and concealing the true ownership of assets. Facilitation of money laundering is a criminal offense in many countries and carries significant legal penalties. It is important for financial institutions and other organizations to have robust anti-money laundering systems in place to prevent and detect this type of activity."
Fake check,"Fake check fraud is a type of scam in which an individual or business is tricked into accepting a fraudulent or counterfeit check as payment for goods or services. The fraudster typically sends a check for an amount far higher than the amount due, requesting that the extra money be sent back to them. The scam is especially dangerous because there is usually a significant lag between the time when the fake check is accepted and the point at which the bank discovers that it is fraudulent. In some cases, the victim may not realize for months or even years that the check was counterfeit. The best way to avoid falling victim to this scam is to always verify the checks thoroughly, including calling up the bank that issued it, before cashing it or depositing it into your account."
Fake merchandise,"Fake merchandise is a term used to describe counterfeit products that are made to look like a genuine item but are sold as an imitation. Fake merchandise typically includes items such as clothing, jewelry, accessories, electronics and even luxury items. The purpose of fake merchandise is to deceive consumers by coming across as a genuine product. In most cases, price is a strong indicator of authenticity and fake merchandise is often sold at substantially lower prices than the original items. The quality of fake merchandise is often extremely poor, often inferior to the original items, and can be dangerous in some cases. Fake merchandise is estimated to cost the world's economy billions of dollars a year in lost revenue and puts consumers at risk of being scammed or purchasing low quality or unsafe products."
False Account Entries,"False Account Entries is an accounting term used to describe an entry made in a ledger, or other booklet of record, which is either not supported by appropriate documentation or is contrary to accepted accounting principles. This type of entry is often made with intention to deceive or commit fraud in order to divert funds or assets. False account entries alter the true financial position of a company and may appear in balance sheets, income statements, cash flows, and other financial statements. Some common false entry tactics include understatement or overstatement of assets/liabilities, misclassification of expenses and revenues, and inflation/deflation of accounts. These practices should be guarded against through internal controls and regular audits."
False Data,"False data is any data that is being purposely misrepresented or incorrectly reported. This can either involve the manipulation of existing data or the introduction of new, false data. False data can be used to manipulate records or to set up fraudulent accounts. It can also be used to anonymize malicious activities on networks and in databases. False data can occur in physical or digital records, and it can be used to inflate expenses, conceal illegal activity, hide stolen funds, mislead the public, and manipulate stock prices. It is important for organizations to be aware of false data and to have safeguards and security measures in place to detect and prevent it from occurring."
False Declines,"False declines occur when an automated system mistakenly flags a legitimate transaction as fraudulent and then blocks the payment. This is an increasingly prevalent problem in the fraud prevention industry due to the increasing complexity of cyber security measures and the reliance on automated systems. False declines result in a loss of business because retailers stop genuine customers from purchasing items and services. The effects of this problem can become especially damaging for smaller businesses, which are often more vulnerable to false declines because of limited resources for first-level fraud controls. In order to prevent false declines, merchants should implement comprehensive monitoring with multiple layers of analysis from different angles, as well as careful manual reviews of every transaction."
False Documents,"False documents are documents that contain false information; they have been modified, manipulated, and/or altered for malicious reasons. Fraudsters may use false documents to falsely claim services, such as healthcare or unemployment benefits, or to misrepresent their identities or backgrounds. They can also be used to commit financial fraud or identity theft, such as using false tax returns to obtain credit cards or fraudulent passports to access bank accounts. The production and dissemination of false documents is a tool used to gain illegal access to resources. Hackers can also use false documents, such as fake application forms, to obtain sensitive information to attack networks and manipulate data. As such, preventing the use of false documents is important for the security of both businesses and individuals."
False Expense Claims,"False expense claims, also known as expense account fraud, involves the submission of fraudulent reimbursement requests for expenses that were either never incurred or where the amount claimed is larger than the actual amount incurred. In some cases, a person may seek reimbursement for a personal expense, ostensibly as a business expense, or may file multiple claims for the same expense. This type of fraud is especially hard to detect and can be extremely costly to a company. Common schemes involve submitting fictitious receipts and/or inflating the amounts on legitimate claims. Companies can minimize these frauds by implementing stringent control measures, basic accounting principles, and auditing procedures to detect false expense claims."
False Expense Reimbursements,"False expense reimbursements are a type of fraud that occurs when a person or organization uses inflated or fictitious expenses to obtain money from an employer or other source. This type of fraud often goes undetected as the perpetrator often creates phony documents or receipts to support their claims. False expense reimbursements can be difficult to detect because they require a thorough audit and careful examination of business records. The goal of this type of fraud is to steal funds from an employer or other source without their knowledge. False expense reimbursements can occur in various forms including requesting reimbursement for travel and entertainment expenses, claiming expenses for non-work related events, and using corporate credit cards for unauthorized purchases. It is important to have a secure system in place to track, monitor and detect any false expense reimbursements. By implementing effective fraud detection and prevention, organizations can protect(...)"
False Financial Statements,"False Financial Statements are a type of fraudulent activity that involves intentionally misstating the financial performance or health of a business. This can take the form of either knowingly understating assets, liabilities or revenues, or overstating them. It is done to either manipulate a business’ attractiveness to potential investors or creditors, to present an inaccurate picture of a company’s performance for personal gain or to reduce taxes or expenses. These false statements can be either intentional or unintentional, depending on the situation. However, regardless of intent, making false financial statements is illegal and can result in civil and criminal penalties."
False Front Merchants,"False Front Merchants are scam artists who create illicit businesses to impersonate legitimate companies. These businesses are often referred to as ""sham companies"" or ""shell companies"" and they're mainly used as a vehicle to commit fraud or launder money. False Front Merchants will often establish business accounts and even file tax returns, while all the while concealing their true status and activities. They may also purchase real or virtual office space, hire staff, and solicit business in order to appear legitimate. By creating a False Front Merchant, criminals can illegally gain access to the payments systems of the company they are impersonating in order to steal funds. It is essential for businesses to be aware of any potential False Front Merchants in their area in order to protect themselves from fraudulent activities."
False Identity Fraud,"False Identity Fraud is a type of identity theft or fraud where a criminal uses a counterfeit or stolen identity to open bank accounts, apply for loans and credit cards, receive merchandise, or to defraud companies and individuals. The criminal usually creates a fictitious identity and provides false documents, such as a driver's license, utility bills, or insurance documents to give the false identity validity. The criminal may also use a stolen identity to commit fraud, such as creating a fake website or using a fake name to purchase goods or services online. The criminal may also use an identity to commit other financial-related crimes, such as obtaining government documents or access to valuable financial information. False Identity Fraud is a serious crime, and victims can experience significant financial and emotional damages."
False Invoices,"False invoices are fraudulent documents used to commit financial fraud. They are constructed to mimic legitimate vendor invoices and are used to draw funds from a company’s treasury. False invoices may contain fictitious or bogus charges, inflate the cost of actual services rendered, or be billed from a phony vendor. Companies can be victimized as a result of broken internal controls or a lack of attention to detail. Fraudsters can disguise a false invoice as a legitimate request for payment, making it difficult for even the most sophisticated accounting departments to detect. Companies should have robust policies and procedures in place to ensure all invoices are properly reviewed and fraud is minimized."
False Negative,"False Negative is a type of misclassification that occurs when an algorithm fails to detect an actual threat or anomaly. This could be a result of a lack of data or not enough features being considered, or it can happen when the features of the attempt are too similar to legitimate activity. This can lead to false security, as malicious actors can exploit the security system's ineffectiveness. As such, false negatives are important to consider when designing and deploying a fraud prevention or cybersecurity system. The system needs to be able to pick up on suspicious activity and alert the necessary parties. It is also important to assess the data and features used for detection and ensure that the algorithm can accurately separate the anomalous from the legitimate. Failure to do so can leave the resources vulnerable to attack and manipulation."
False Positive,"False Positive is a term used to describe a type of error where a system or programme incorrectly classifies an innocent or normal activity as suspicious or malicious. It may also refer to an outcome of a security system (e.g. a security alert) that is caused by something that is not an attack or malicious action. It is actually a false alarm, as the action or alert rarely poses any real threat. In other words, False Positive occurs when a system incorrectly labels a normal activity as anomalous. In the context of fraud prevention, false positives typically occur when a system flags false positives on legitimate transactions. This could result in delays or even rejection of those transactions, and this can be incredibly costly to businesses. Through the use of sophisticated algorithms and techniques, businesses can help reduce the chances of false positives."
False Rejects,"False rejects are a type of security breach where a supposedly secure system incorrectly denies a valid user access, leading to a security vulnerability. False rejects occur when a user’s credentials (i.e., username and password) are accurately entered but are then denied authentication due to a security system malfunction. False rejects can occur when a user is incorrectly identified as a malicious intruder or the system fails to differentiate between a routine user and an attacker. Additionally, false rejects can occur when the authentication parameters are set too strictly, such as when a maximum-length password is not accepted. False rejects can also occur if legitimate users are locked out of an account incorrectly or if the system fails to recognize an authorized user due to an expired credentials or a technical glitch."
False Report,"False report is the term used to describe an incident where false data or information is presented to an institution, such as a government agency or commercial entity, for the purpose of gaining a benefit or committing a crime. False reporting can occur both unintentionally and maliciously. Within fraud prevention and cyber security, false reporting is a serious risk which must be monitored and mitigated as best as possible in order to protect the organization from possible financial or reputational losses. False reporting can include the creation and submission of fake paperwork, falsified witness statements, or even fabricating whole scenarios in an effort to manipulate results or exploit weaknesses. This type of behavior is hard to detect and can be extremely costly to an organization if undetected. It is important that cyber security and fraud prevention teams take extra measures to ensure that false reports are not successful."
False Reporting,"False reporting is the presentation of false claims or data in order to deceive or mislead. It typically occurs when a perpetrator attempts to generate false financial or personal gain through fraud or negligence. False reporting is illegal and can have a detrimental effect on both individuals and organizations. It can take many forms such as providing a false account of an incident, making false statements about an individual's assets and liabilities, or providing inaccurate or fraudulent financial records. It is important for organizations to have an adequate fraud-prevention system in place to detect and prevent false reporting from occurring. Effective fraud monitoring, prevention and detection measures can help to reduce the risk of false reporting."
False Sales Invoices,"False sales invoices are when an individual or business creates a fake or inflated invoice to manipulate financial reporting. This fraud can take many forms; for example, creating fictitious invoices for nonexistent goods or services, creating invoices with heavily discounted prices, or creating duplicate invoices with altered amounts. This type of fraud is usually committed to inflate sales figures or conceal diverted receipts. It's relatively easy to set up false sales invoices, since an invoice doesn’t always determine liability or the amount due. As a result, it's important to have fraud prevention methods in place to monitor invoices and ensure everything is proper. This includes oversight of the accounts payable department and periodic reviews of vendor invoices. Businesses should also check customer invoices and records to verify the original order."
False Statements,"False Statements is a broad term that encompasses any statement that is false or misleading, and is intended to deceive or commit fraud. In the context of Anti-Money Laundering, false statements are often used to hide the true source or destination of funds. Examples include providing false information on a bank account, providing false information on a customer identification form, or providing false information on an international fund transfer. False statements can also be used to conceal the proceeds of fraudulent activity, such as tax evasion or terrorist financing. When false statements are provided, they can obstruct investigations and lead to criminal prosecution. It is essential that Anti-Money Laundering experts have a thorough knowledge of false statements and their implications in order to identify and prevent such activities."
False Travel Claim,"False travel claim (FTC) is an act of attempting to receive a financial benefit for a travel expense that was not incurred. It typically involves the attempt to defraud a travel or expense management provider or claim insurer by fabricating, exaggerating, or falsifying travel expenses. It can also involve misrepresenting an expense or hiding a true destination. This can be done through a variety of means including falsifying expense receipts, providing false accounting or banking details, or citing a false destination. In some cases, the fraudulent allowance may have to be paid back. Fraud prevention and cyber security experts work to detect and prevent this kind of fraud. This can be done through the use of fraud detection algorithms, data analysis, automated checks, and review of documentation."
False Vendors,"False vendors are entities who fraudulently use a legitimate vendor as a false identity. This is done to gain trust or access to sensitive information and data for malicious purposes. False vendors can appear legitimate and can pose significant risks to organizations, as they have access to sensitive data and have the potential to launch cyber-attacks. False vendors can operate with different motives, ranging from financial theft and identity theft, to the spread of malware or ransomware. Companies must take measures to identify and monitor for false vendors, including performing due diligence on vendors before entering into any agreement, frequently reviewing vendor accounts and systems, and enabling internal audits and regular monitoring of vendor activity. It is also important to develop policies and processes to identify vendors who may be part of a malicious network. Proper security measures, such as two-factor authentication and encryption, can also help protect a company(...)"
Falsified Hours,"Falsified hours are a type of fraud that is perpetrated when an employee or contractor claims to have worked more hours than they actually did and receives a payment they are not entitled to. These situations can occur in many industries, such as software development, remote jobs, manufacturing, and consulting. This type of fraud may be committed by either intentionally submitting false records or by creating a record the employee knows is incorrect. Common indicators of falsified hours may include overtime being requested before usual hours are filled, timesheets with sudden changes in times, invoices without any times being listed, and more. Companies can prevent this type of fraud by creating proper oversight systems and processes to ensure accuracy and accountability in record keeping, as well as using advanced analytics to uncover discrepancies."
Familiar Fraud,"Familiar Fraud is a type of fraud where the person taking advantage of a victim is essentially someone the victim knows. A common example of this includes a family member deceiving an elderly relative with financial schemes. It typically involves taking advantage of a deep personal relationship with the victim in order to manipulate them, exploiting their trust and familiarity with the fraudster in such a way that it makes them more vulnerable to falling victim to fraud. Familiar Fraud can range from a variety of financial schemes such as identity theft to obtaining credit cards through deceit or even taking over a deceased family member's pension benefits."
Fast Flux,"Fast flux is a technique used by cyber criminals to quickly and dynamically change the IP addresses of compromised web servers. The aim of this technique is to avoid detection and make it more difficult for security analysts to identify malicious activity. This technique is often used in conjunction with malicious botnets to hide malicious activity, such as phishing and spam campaigns, from detection. The system works by rapidly changing the mapping of domain names to IP addresses, making it difficult for attackers to be identified and tracked as the IP addresses change. The speed of the changing of the IPs has to be faster than the detection rate of network administrators in order for fast flux to be effective."
Fast Identity Online (FIDO),"Fast Identity Online (FIDO) is a secure authentication protocol which provides a combination of public key cryptography, multi-factor authentication, and biometrics to establish secure, user-friendly authentication. FIDO offers multiple layers of authentication and supports password-less authentication, eliminating the need for shared secrets and reducing the risk of phishing and other fraud. FIDO supports a broad range of authentication mechanisms such as biometrics, one-time passwords, and public key authentication. All authentication is done locally and securely, without the need for data transmission, making it an ideal solution for secure authentication in today's world. FIDO is becoming increasingly more popular for secure authentication due to its enhanced security measures and user-friendly nature."
Fault Line Attacks,"A Fault Line Attack is a type of cyber attack that exploits the weaknesses of a company’s system in order to gain access to sensitive information. Fault Line Attacks are typically conducted by manipulating a flaw in the system or by exploiting an existing vulnerability. These attacks can be used to penetrate networks and systems, steal data, or disrupt operations. This type of attack is especially dangerous because it allows an attacker to bypass traditional security measures, such as firewalls, authentication protocols, and encryption. Fault Line Attacks can be difficult to detect and prevent due to their subtle yet highly effective nature. For this reason, organizations must take steps to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities to ensure their systems are not vulnerable to attack."
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Bank (FFIEC),"The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) was established in 1979 by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision. It is a formal interagency body that administers and enforces the regulations of the US federal government and state governments on financial institutions. The FFIEC Bank provides guidance on anti-money laundering, Bank Secrecy Act, and other policies and regulations related to the banking industry. The FFIEC Bank also conducts and coordinates examinations of financial institutions to ensure compliance and to help identify and prevent money laundering."
Fictitious Refunds,"Fictitious refunds is a type of fraud in which criminals make false claims of refunds on goods they did not purchase, which they can then collect or transfer the money elsewhere. This type of fraud may involve the use of stolen credit cards or other methods of payment. It may involve the manipulation of invoices or other documents to make it seem as if the return is legitimate. Other methods may include tampering with electronic transactions, refund forms and applications, or other methods of payment. Fraudsters may even provide fake return addresses or routing numbers in order to receive their fraudulent refunds. The result of this form of fraud usually results in financial loss for the retailer or merchant and increases the risk of identity theft."
Fileless Malware,"Fileless malware is a type of malicious code that is used to infect a computer system without relying on files as its primary form of delivery. This type of malware utilizes existing operating system tools, such as Windows PowerShell and WMI, to execute and evade detection. Once executed, fileless malware can perform a range of activities, such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or command execution. Fileless malware is difficult to detect due to its non-traditional nature and requires advanced cybersecurity solutions to detect and protect against."
Final Rule Part 504,"Final Rule Part 504 is a U.S. Treasury Department regulation which requires financial institutions to develop and maintain Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Programs. These programs must include the establishment of policies, procedures, and internal controls to ensure the detection and reporting of suspicious activities, as well as the maintenance of records and reports. Additionally, the rule requires financial institutions to designate an AML compliance officer, and implement customer due diligence and risk-based AML compliance monitoring systems. This Final Rule serves as the foundation of the AML program for financial institutions and sets the expectation for a comprehensive framework of AML compliance."

An FIU also provides financial intelligence to other countries, international organizations, and relevant private sector entities in order to identify, disrupt, and dismantle criminal activities."
Financial Sanctions,"Financial sanctions are measures taken by governments, international organizations and other stakeholders to restrict and prohibit financial flows for the purpose of countering money laundering, terrorist financing and other activities which pose a threat to the integrity of the financial system. Sanctions typically include asset freezes, prohibitions against providing financial services or support to designated individuals or entities, travel bans, and prohibitions against transacting with individuals or entities designated as non-compliant. The objective of financial sanctions is to disrupt and prevent the financing of illegal activities, while at the same time preserving the integrity of the financial system."
Financing Of Proliferation,"Financing of proliferation is the process of using money in illicit or non-transparent ways to fund the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). It involves the use of proceeds from financial activities or organizations to purchase items or services that are used to support the development, production, or delivery of WMD. Some examples include the use of proceeds from drug trafficking or other criminal activities to purchase components of WMD, or the use of funds from shell companies to purchase materials to construct a nuclear weapon. Anti-money laundering experts are essential in identifying and stopping these activities, as well as developing strategies to disrupt the financing of proliferation."
Financing Of Terrorism,"Financing of terrorism is the provision of financial services or resources, including funds, goods and services, to individuals or groups involved in terrorist activities. It can be done through a range of financial mechanisms such as donations, charity work, or illicit activities like money laundering and illicit financial flows. Financing of terrorism can also be done through transfer of funds from one jurisdiction to another, through the opening of accounts abroad, or through the use of shell companies. Anti-money laundering experts must be able to detect, investigate, and prevent terrorist financing activities by keeping a close eye on suspicious transactions and by preventing the use of the financial system for terrorist purposes."

This includes monitoring customer activity, assessing customer risk, and developing and implementing financial crime prevention programs."
Fingerprint Recognition,"Fingerprint recognition is a biometric identification process that uses an individual's unique physical characteristics to verify his or her identity. It involves capturing an image of a person's finger using a special scanner and then comparing this image to a database of previously collected and stored finger scans. The accuracy of the system depends on the quality and authenticity of the data being used. Fingerprint recognition is widely used in government, financial, and healthcare organizations as an extra layer of protection against fraud and unauthorized access. Additionally, it can be used to grant access to physical and logical items. While fingerprint recognition is considered one of the most reliable methods to verify identity, it is not foolproof and can be compromised by factors such as wear and tear, environmental factors, and chemical exposure."
Fingerprinting,"Fingerprinting is a cyber security method used to identify machines, applications, and users on a network by leveraging specific characteristics or metrics. This allows for identification of hosts and devices, as well as software and applications on the network. It uses a measurement of the characteristics such as software versions, order of user actions, and active services to create a profile or 'fingerprint' of the machine or user. Fingerprinting is an important tool for security teams to use to monitor networks, detect malicious activity, and provide visibility into all of the devices and services on their network."
Fintech,"FinTech (Financial Technology) is the use of technology to improve financial services. This includes the use of technology to streamline processes, make financial transactions faster and more secure, and create new financial products and services. FinTech has opened up a range of possibilities, allowing banks, credit card companies and other financial institutions to offer customers access to new products and services that were previously unavailable. FinTech also provides Anti-Money Laundering (AML) experts with the tools to detect, investigate and prevent money laundering activity on a global scale. By utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data Analytics, AML experts are able to uncover suspicious activity and help prevent money laundering on a large scale."
Fintech Fraud,"Fintech Fraud is a type of financial fraud that involves the misuse of technology-driven financial services, such as mobile banking, online payments, virtual currencies, and automated investment platforms. Criminals leverage weaknesses in IT systems and the design of financial services in order to gain access to users' information and financial resources. The most common types of Fintech Fraud include phishing, social engineering, and account takeover attacks. Whenever a user's financial credentials are exposed, it opens them up to Fraud. Organizations can defend against such attacks by taking measures such as implementing multi-factor authentication, keeping software up-to-date, and actively monitoring suspicious activity."
Firewall,"A firewall is a security system designed to create an electronic barrier between a computer or network and any unauthorized access. It is used to protect a business or organization from malicious software, hackers, and other potential threats to the organization’s computers and data. Firewalls can be either hardware- or software-based and use a variety of methods to block unauthorised access. They filter traffic, employ encryption and authentication, and can define protocols to limit the type of traffic that a user can access. Firewalls help protect a computer or network from outside sources, but they can also be used to restrict access to applications and programs within an organization."
First Line Of Defense,"The first line of defense against money laundering is a set of policies, procedures, and practices designed to identify and prevent the laundering of money. This includes the identification and reporting of suspicious transactions, the implementation of customer due diligence measures, and the adoption of anti-money laundering training and education for staff. It is key to ensure that all employees understand the organization’s anti-money laundering policy, procedures and controls and that they are adhered to. The first line of defense is not only important to protect an organization from the potential financial and reputational risks associated with money laundering, but also to demonstrate a commitment to compliance with applicable laws and regulations."
Flooding,"A Flooding Attack is a type of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that attempts to overwhelm a target system with traffic. The attacker sends a massive amount of requests to the target, using a large number of compromised hosts or botnets, causing the target system to become unavailable. Flooding attacks are designed to consume large amounts of resources, leaving the target unable to respond to legitimate traffic. The most common types of flooding attacks are SYN floods, UDP floods, and ICMP floods. These attacks can also be combined for a more effective attack. Flooding attacks are effective because they are extremely difficult to detect, mitigate and prevent. The best way to defend against a flooding attack is to adopt Cloud-based or on-premise DDoS protection solutions that continuously monitor traffic for anomalies."
Food Fraud,"Food Fraud is a type of fraud that involves the mislabeling, substitution, dilution or adulteration of food products for the purpose of financial gain. Food Fraud is a global issue and can occur at any stage of the food chain, from the point of production to the point of sale. It may involve products, packaging or documentation, and can be hard to detect. Food Fraud includes product substitution, tampering and mislabeling, as well as illegitimate claims regarding the source of ingredients or health benefits of the product. Food Fraud is especially concerning because it can affect food safety and lead to serious health risks for consumers. It is important to remember that Food Fraud is a continuous global problem and should be monitored carefully."
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA),The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is an important part of the US effort to combat tax evasion by US taxpayers holding investments in foreign financial accounts. FATCA requires foreign financial institutions to report certain information about accounts held by US taxpayers or foreign entities with certain US owners to the IRS. FATCA also imposes withholding taxes on certain payments to foreign financial institutions and non-financial foreign entities that do not comply with FATCA reporting. The purpose of FATCA is to ensure that US taxpayers with offshore investments are paying their fair share of taxes.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA),"The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is an anti-corruption law passed by Congress in 1977 that makes it a crime for certain individuals and companies to bribe foreign officials in order to obtain or retain business. The FCPA applies to all US companies, including US issuers of securities and US citizens and residents, as well as foreign companies and persons who cause, directly or through agents, an act in furtherance of such a corrupt payment to take place within the United States. It is also illegal to falsify books and records in order to conceal the illegal payments. The purpose of the FCPA is to prevent bribery of foreign government officials and protect the integrity of the international marketplace."
Foreign Sanctions Evader (FSE),"Foreign Sanctions Evader (FSE) is a term used to refer to a person, group, or entity that has deliberately violated or attempted to violate, evade, or avoid U.S. economic sanctions against a designated foreign country. FSEs often use sophisticated schemes and tactics to facilitate transactions with a sanctioned country, such as disguise the origin or destination of funds, or conceal the true nature of their activities from U.S. authorities. FSEs may also use offshore accounts, shell companies, and other methods to disguise their financial activity. It is important for Anti-Money Laundering experts to identify FSEs to prevent them from continuing to evade sanctions and potentially profiting from criminal activity."
Forest,"Forest is a term used in Cybersecurity to refer to the grouping of one or more Active Directory Domain Controllers (DCs) into one logical structure. A Forest is used to manage user authentication and authorization, centrally administer policies and user security settings, and provide access to distributed applications. Active Directory Forest allows for a hierarchical structure which can be extended to multiple locations and can be used to control access to resources across multiple domains. It offers a single sign-on option for users of the domain and offers control of how network resources are accessed. Forest is an important part of any organization's security strategy as it allows for strong control measures to be put in place to protect information assets and networks."
Forfeiture,"Forfeiture is the legal process by which the government or law enforcement agencies take possession of assets or property which have been linked to criminal activity, including money laundering. It is one of the most commonly used means of recovering laundered money and tracking down the proceeds of crime. Forfeiture proceedings are often initiated when there is suspicion of money laundering activities, and they typically involve a court order which allows law enforcement to seize bank accounts, vehicles, real estate, or other assets found to be connected with the alleged criminal activity. The seized assets can then be seized and used to pay fines, restitution, or other penalties associated with the criminal activity."
Forged Signatures,"A forged signature is an imitation copy of someone else's signature. It is typically used in order to commit fraud by impersonating someone else or presenting a false identity to gain access to someone else's assets, such as financial records or sensitive personal information. Forged signatures can also be used to manipulate documents, such as contracts or legal documents, to either commit fraud or to interfere with business processes. Forged signatures are often hard to detect, making them a common method of fraud, identity theft, and other forms of cybercrime. Cybersecurity experts may employ a variety of detection methods to help uncover forged signatures and prevent them from being used in malicious ways."
Fork Bomb,"A Fork Bomb, also referred to as a Rabbit Virus or Wabbit, is a type of malware that replicates itself in a loop causing an overload on the system resources. The term fork refers to the Unix/Linux command prompt and a fork bomb replicates so rapidly that it quickly exhausts the system's resources, ultimately causing a denial of service to any legitimate user. It will typically consist of a single command or a small script that, when executed, will rapidly create multiple processes that quickly consume all available resources, making the system unusable. The consequences of a fork bomb can be mitigated by limiting the number of processes a user can execute, as well as monitoring process execution for suspicious behavior."
Form-Based Authentication,"Form-based authentication is a security mechanism used to authenticate users of applications or websites. It requires valid credentials, such as a username and password, to prove the user's identity before granting them access. In most cases, once the user is authenticated, they will be given access to the application or website, depending on their permission level. Form-based authentication also uses security measures, such as HTTPS encryption, two-factor authentication, and captcha verification to ensure that the user's data is not compromised. It provides increased security by ensuring that the user is indeed who they claim to be and that their data is safe from malicious attacks."
Fortune Teller Scam,"Fortune teller scams are a particular type of fraud in which the scammer pretends to be a fortune teller or psychic. Through this deception, the fraudster convinces his victim to trust him and pay him for a “reading” of the future. The scammer then often tells the victim about a potential upcoming calamity, and encourages the victim to do something to avoid it, such as sending money. When the victim sends the money, the scammer then vanishes, leaving the victim with only a feeling of having been taken advantage of. The fraudster may also take further advantage of the victim by asking further fees or tending to involve the victim in other illegal activities. Victims of the fortune teller scam may be left feeling vulnerable and isolated, particularly when their trusting nature has been taken advantage of."
Forward Lookup,"Forward lookup is a method of using a Domain Name System (DNS) to search for a domain or hostname, and obtain an associated IP address. This process is used to resolve domain names to their associated IP address in order to direct traffic on a network. To complete a forward lookup, a server sends a DNS query to a DNS server which contains the domain name, and the DNS server responds with the IP address associated with that domain name. To improve efficiency, the DNS server caches the lookups in order to reduce the number of queries and the amount of time required to complete them. Forward lookup plays an important role in cyber security as it allows for quick and efficient monitoring of network traffic and can help identify malicious activity."
Forward Proxy,"A forward proxy is a type of proxy server that is used to access remote websites and services on behalf of the clients. It receives requests from clients, forwards the requests to the destination server and then returns the response to the client. The primary purpose of forward proxies is to hide the source of the requests so that the target server does not know who the original requestor is. This type of proxy also gives organizations the ability to control the content that their users access since the requests are handled by the proxy server instead of the users directly. By having a forward proxy in place, organizations can monitor and filter out malicious content, block websites and limit user access to certain websites. They can also use the forward proxy to log user activities and enforce security policies."
Fourth Eu Money Laundering Directive (MLD4),"The Fourth EU Money Laundering Directive (MLD4) is a directive issued by the European Union in 2015 that provides comprehensive rules to prevent and combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The directive builds on the previous three and sets out measures to better strengthen the risk-based approach to anti-money laundering (AML) and require greater customer due diligence (CDD). MLD4 also requires more robust and effective national measures to be put in place and establishes a stronger framework for cooperation and information sharing between different stakeholders and Member States. MLD4 also sets out stricter rules for beneficial ownership, customer identification and monitoring of transactions."
Fragment Offset,"Fragment Offset is a term used in computer networking. It is a type of packet reassembly used in the internet protocol (IP) to break large packets of data into small pieces for more efficient transport over a network. Fragment offset indicates which portion of the original packet the particular fragment belongs to. It is a two-byte field in the IP header that is used to provide the relative position of each fragment within the original data packet. By combining the fragment offset with the size of the fragment, the original data packet can be reconstituted. Fragment offset is an important tool used in network security, as it can be used to break apart malicious traffic and detect threats."
Fragment Overlap Attack,"A Fragment Overlap Attack is an attack technique used by malicious actors to inject malicious code into an otherwise legitimate web request. The attack works by sending multiple web requests that include the same fragment of data, but with different content. This technique allows the attacker to bypass restrictions imposed by a web application firewall, or to bypass other security measures that may be in place. The attack also allows an attacker to bypass any mechanisms which are designed to detect malicious code. Fragment Overlap attacks can be used to inject malicious code into web applications, which can then be leveraged to gain access to confidential information, or to execute malicious commands. Fragment Overlap attacks are a common form of attack and can be difficult to prevent, so it is important to employ proper security measures to help protect against this type of attack."

Fraudsters may also create elaborate schemes to manipulate game economies by using bots or engaging in other activities to accumulate virtual items and then resell them. The impact of gaming fraud extends beyond players, with game publishers and developers also suffering significant financial losses as a result of fraudulent activities."
Gatekeepers,"Gatekeepers are individuals or organizations responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. They may be employed by financial institutions, regulatory bodies, or other organizations actively involved in preventing money laundering activities. They are responsible for monitoring financial transactions, identifying suspicious activity, investigating red flags, and reporting suspicious activity to the appropriate authorities. Gatekeepers also need to ensure compliance with the laws, regulations and rules, and also to understand the specific risks posed by different customers and products. They also need to provide advice and guidance to customers to help them understand their AML obligations."
Gateway,"A gateway is a type of network security device that acts as an intermediary between two networks, acting as an access control point for traffic going from one network to the other. This type of security device provides security by acting as a single point of access, allowing only authorized traffic to pass in and out of the network. In addition to this, gateways also provide secure data transmission, allowing for encryption of sensitive data, making it much more difficult for malicious actors to obtain. Gateways also provide other types of security, including intrusion detection and prevention, network access control, and anti-virus protection. All of these features help to protect an organization's data and secure the network against threats."
Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOS),"Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) are a tool used by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to combat money laundering and terrorist financing by imposing specific recordkeeping and reporting requirements on businesses and individuals in geographic areas that are at high risk for money laundering and other financial crimes. GTOs are a valuable tool for FinCEN to target illicit activity in a particular area, as they require banks and other financial institutions to report information such as the nature of financial transactions and the identity of the parties involved. The orders are typically issued for a specific period of time, and they allow FinCEN to better monitor financial activity in the designated areas."
Geographical IP Detector,"Geographical IP Detector is a technology used to determine the geographical location of a user based on their IP Address. It can be used by organizations and individuals to detect fraudulent activities associated with users accessing their systems or website. The technology works by recognizing an IP address or language settings of a user to assign a country or region. Depending on the sophistication of the tool, the geographical IP Detector may also be able to recognize variables such as city, county, ISP, and even the ASN (Autonomous System Number) of the connecting device. This data can then be compared against existing profiles to help detect fraudulent activity when different sources report a discrepancy. Geographical IP Detector can help ensure compliance to jurisdictional laws, reduce financial costs associated with fraud, and prevent a variety of online threats such as identity theft and online scams."
Geolocation Detection,"Geolocation detection is a type of technology used to identify the physical location of a user or device. This is usually done through the internet, GPS, and other techniques. The goal of geolocation detection is to provide a layer of fraud protection by knowing the whereabouts of users and their devices. This may be used in multiple scenarios to assess the authenticity of accounts or information, block suspicious activity, and/or track online purchases. This technology works by identifying a device’s IP address and mapping it to its physical location. This information can then be compared against certain limitations such as country, region, or even city to detect any inconsistencies. Geolocation detection thus helps businesses and organizations detect and prevent fraudulent activity."
Ghost Employee,"Ghost employees, also sometimes called “ghost workers” or “ghost members”, are fraudulent employees, usually fictitious or loosely based on real employees, on a company’s payroll that are added to the company’s system without any prior identification or appropriate authorization. They “live” in the payroll system, receiving a salary “phantom” salary without ever showing up to work. Ghost employees can be used to leech money from a company, conceal kickbacks, and receive government benefits such as unemployment insurance, social security and pension funds. Detecting ghost employees requires significant investigative skills and robust fraud prevention mechanisms, including comprehensive identity verification processes, detailed inspection of payroll records, and regular background checks."
Ghost terminal,"A ghost terminal is a computer system that is not connected to any other computer on the same network, or to the Internet. The term is used in fraud prevention and cyber security to refer to a system that is operating as if it were connected to another system. This is done in order to monitor the activities of the other system without the other system's knowledge. A ghost terminal can be used to monitor suspicious activities on a network or computer, or to test new features without risking the security of the system. Ghost terminals can also be used to conduct malware analysis, by running a malicious file without infecting the main system. Such a terminal is often referred to as a 'honeypot' as well."
Gift Card Scammer Numbers,"A gift card scammer number is a phone number used by scammers to impersonate official customer support services. The number is typically used to contact victims and lure them into providing personal details or payment card information. The scammer may also attempt to manipulate the victim into activating a gift card or purchasing e-commerce gift cards. The caller may also promise free items or services to encourage victims to provide the gift card number. The scammer may also offer a ""special deal"" in an effort to get victims to purchase a certain gift card. In many cases, these numbers are anonymous and untraceable, making it difficult for victims to seek recourse after the scam takes place."
Global Address Verification Directories,"Global Address Verification (GAV) Directories are databases that provide accurate international address validation in order to combat fraud and prevent cybercrime. These databases are composed of up-to-date data sets from numerous sources and private and public organizations, including postal service addresses, companies, and research laboratories. The data sets contain postal codes, names, street addresses, phone numbers, and email accounts. The GAV directories are used to verify the identity of customers, especially those outside the country, to ensure that they can be trusted. Additionally, they provide access to real-time address analytics and information that helps to detect unusual behaviour and evaluate risk. Thus, GAV Directories are essential tools in fraud prevention measures in the global digital economy."
Global Program Against Money Laundering (GPML),"The Global Program against Money Laundering (GPML) is a global effort coordinated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental body whose mission is to ensure that countries around the world have and maintain effective anti-money laundering (AML) measures. The GPML is structured around a set of FATF Recommendations, which lay out the legal, regulatory and operational measures that countries should take to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. GPML focuses on two distinct but complementary objectives: (1) helping countries to implement the FATF Recommendations, and (2) gathering, analyzing, and disseminating information on money laundering trends and techniques. Through this program, countries are able to assess their AML/CFT measures, improve their AML/CFT legal and regulatory frameworks, and better prevent, detect, and prosecute money laundering and terrorist financing."

GRC is an important part of an organization's overall strategy for managing risk and achieving regulatory compliance."
Government Or State Owned Body (GSB),"Government or State Owned Body (GSB) is a type of organization that is owned, operated and managed by a government or a state. GSBs can provide services in a variety of sectors such as finance, transportation, energy, and health care, and can be public, private, or a hybrid of both. GSBs typically have a unique legal framework that allows them to operate with a degree of autonomy separate from the government or state. In terms of anti-money laundering, GSBs must be compliant with the regulations of their respective countries, as well as international standards, in order to prevent illicit money laundering activity."
GPS Spoofer,"GPS spoofing is a form of cyber attack where a perpetrator transmits false GPS signals to a device receiving GPS signals in order to interfere with its navigation or location capabilities. Attackers can easily generate GPS signals that are identical to legitimate transmissions, but supply the device with false location data. This can be done by broadcasting radio signals imitating those of a legitimate satellite. Upon receiving the false GPS signals, the device is tricked and believes the fake locations, rather than its real coordinates. This can potentially be used to disrupt GPS-reliant services, such as autonomous car navigation or drone flight, which can be disastrous and have catastrophic results if taken advantage of by malicious actors."
Grandparent Scam,"The Grandparent Scam is an advanced fee fraud tactic whereby fraudsters pose as an elderly grandparent or another relative, claiming to be in need of urgent financial assistance. The fraudster will typically contact the victim pretending to be in a desperate situation, such as being detained in a foreign country, stranded in an airport, or arrested while travelling. The fraudster will ask the victim to wire money to them in order to solve the issue. In some cases they may even use personal details they have acquired online to make the request more believable. Victims should always have some way of verifying the identity of the caller before sending any financial assistance."
Grantor,"A grantor is an individual (or entity) who provides, transfers, or conveys property or other assets to another person or entity, usually in the form of a trust. The grantor is responsible for creating the trust, specifying the terms of the trust, and transferring assets from the grantor to the trust. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) experts must be aware of the grantor's identity and source of the transferred assets in order to ensure that the terms of the trust are met and to prevent the use of trusts for illicit purposes. Additionally, AML experts must ensure that the grantor is not engaging in any suspicious activity that could potentially involve money laundering."
Grey List,"A grey list is a list of entities or countries that are seen to be non-compliant with anti-money laundering standards, yet are not considered to be high risk. Grey listed entities have some standards or principles that need to be met in order to be removed from the list. They are subject to further monitoring and scrutiny from financial institutions and enforcement authorities to ensure that their activities and facilities are not being used for money laundering or terrorism financing. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is a worldwide organization that helps countries create and monitor their anti-money laundering policies, and also identifies and reviews countries on the grey list. Being on the grey list can have significant financial impacts, including increased scrutiny from regulators, compliance costs, and reduced access to financial services."

It typically involves collecting information such as a full name, address, date of birth, a copy of an official government-issued identification document, and other data. This can involve manual and automated processes, such as background checks, facial recognition, and document authentication. Through KYC, an organization can reduce the risk of fraud, minimize identity theft, and better comply with regulations. It is also a crucial first step in developing a trusting relationship with the customer."
Lattice Techniques,"The term lattice techniques refers to a type of encryption technology used to protect data in a shared environment. It is based on mathematical structures known as lattices, which are used to represent the data. This encryption technology provides a high level of security and can be used to protect a wide variety of data, including passwords, financial information, documents and other sensitive data. Unlike many other encryption technologies, lattice techniques rely on the fact that it is hard to determine a pattern in a random sequence of characters. This makes it difficult for an attacker to decipher the encrypted data. Furthermore, lattice techniques are also immune to brute force attacks, since they rely on the sheer amount of characters present in the encrypted data. As a result, lattice techniques can be an excellent tool for protecting data in a shared environment."
Law Enforcement,"Law enforcement refers to the practice of enforcing laws and regulations, typically by police, courts, and other government agencies. This practice is part of a larger system of criminal justice which seeks to prevent crime and ensure public safety in society. Law enforcement officers particularly police officers, have the authority to make arrests, perform searches, use force, and detain suspects. Additionally, they are responsible for enforcing laws related to traffic violations, drugs, property crimes, and organized crime. Other aspects of law enforcement, such as criminal investigations, intelligence gathering, and community policing are also part of the overall mission of keeping society safe."
Layer 2 Forwarding Protocol (L2F),"Layer 2 Forwarding Protocol (L2F) is a communication protocol that operates at the second layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. L2F is used to forward and switch data over a network of multiple systems by encapsulating packets within a single session. It is essential for data security as it protects communications between two systems that are connected to the same network. Furthermore, L2F allows for data integrity and authentication, as well as protection against denial of service attacks. In summary, L2F is a critical component in secure data transmission and switching."
Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP),"Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) is a network protocol used to create tunneled connections between two networks across the Internet. L2TP is a combination of two separate protocols: the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F). Once the tunnel is established, L2TP encapsulates PPP packets and sends them over the Internet. By doing this, L2TP provides security, privacy, and authentication of data transferred over the Internet. In addition, L2TP can also provide encryption, thus allowing data to be securely transferred between two networks. As L2TP is a primarily used for tunneling between two networks, it is frequently used for connecting remote users to a corporate network."
Layering,"Layering is a technique used by criminals who attempt to conceal the illegal origin of funds obtained through criminal activities. It involves multiple transactions, often through different financial instruments and countries, to obfuscate and obscure the money's origin. Layering involves transferring money or other assets between different accounts and entities, making it difficult to trace the money’s origin or purpose. The objective of layering is to make the money appear to be from a legitimate source and to make it hard for law enforcement to detect and trace the laundered money. Layering also helps criminals reduce their risk of detection by making it more difficult for authorities to establish the origin, movement and ownership of the funds."
Least Privilege,"Least privilege (also known as the principle of least privilege) is a fundamental security concept that dictates that an individual, process, or service should only have access to the exact resources it needs to carry out its duties. In other words, the principle of least privilege means that each user or service should only have access to the minimum amount of resources and privileges necessary, allowing for the elimination of potential loopholes and vulnerabilities. By following the principle of least privilege, organizations can reduce the attack surface from malicious actors looking to take advantage of weak security protocols and practices. This reduces the potential for incident response and greatly enhances overall system security."
Lending,"Lending is the process of giving money or other assets to an individual or organization, expecting it to be paid back with interest. It usually involves a financial institution assessing an individual’s creditworthiness and authorizing a loan of a certain amount at an agreed-upon interest rate. This process involves a degree of risk as the lender assumes that they will not receive the full amount of the loan back. To mitigate this risk, financial institutions employ fraud prevention and cyber security measures to ensure their lenders are not putting themselves at risk of fraudulent activities. These measures involve data protection and fraud risk assessments, identity verification checks, security protocols, and monitoring systems to detect and prevent unauthorized access, malicious attacks, and data breaches."
Level of Assurance,"Level of Assurance (LOA) is a security measure used to assess the strength of authentication processes. It is used to gauge the confidence in the identity of an individual or entity that has been authenticated. LOA is determined using a number of factors, such as the type and strength of authentication factors used, the number of authentication factors used, the relative strength of each, the technical security settings of the system or application, and the dynamics of the authentication process. The higher the LOA, the greater the confidence that the identity of the person or entity being authenticated is correct. LOA is important for maintaining the security of organisations and its customers as it allows them to assess the trustworthiness of an authentication process."
Liability Shift,"Liability Shift is a term used in the context of fraud prevention and cyber security that refers to the transfer of responsibility from one customer to another. It typically applies when one party is held liable for a transaction that has been made using their payment card. The party liable for a transaction is usually the customer, though in some cases there may be a third party payment processor or merchant that is responsible. In such cases, the Liability Shift refers to the transfer of responsibility to the third party or merchant. Liability Shift can also refer to the legal consequence of using digital payment tools such as online banking, digital wallets, and cryptomarkets, where the customer is typically responsible for any losses due to unauthorized transactions or security failures."
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP),"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an open, cross-platform protocol used to manage and access directory services, primarily for user authentication and authorization. LDAP servers use a hierarchical structure to store and organize objects, such as users and groups, in a directory. It provides different operations to perform on the objects, such as searching, modifying, and creating. To ensure data integrity and ensure the privacy of users, LDAP uses secure authentication methods and encryption. LDAP's main purpose is to provide a centralized and secure repository of user information, which can be used to provide access control and authorization for applications and services."
Link Jacking,"Link jacking is a type of cyber attack in which malicious actors inject malicious code into legitimate links or websites with the purpose of redirecting users to different websites or malicious content. This type of attack is often used to distribute malware, phishing attempts, or other malicious activities. Linkjacking can also be used to hijack user data or steal sensitive information. To protect against this type of attack, organizations should ensure they use HTTPS protocols and monitor links and websites for any strange behavior or malicious code injection. They should also update their security software regularly and educate employees and customers on proper internet security practices."
Link State,"Link State Routing is a type of routing protocol used in computer networks. It is a form of dynamic routing which uses link-state advertisements (LSAs) to exchange information between nodes in the network. LSAs contain local information about the network, such as the cost of links and network topology. This information is used to construct a link-state database, also called a topology table, which is used by the routing protocol to determine the best path for data to reach its destination. Link State Routing employs a distributed algorithm in which each router independently calculates the best path to each destination in the network. This type of routing protocol is considered to be more efficient and reliable than other forms of routing protocols, providing high-level security and reliability against malicious attacks or data traffic."
List Based Access Control,"List Based Access Control (LBAC) is an access control method where access privileges are determined based on user profiles that define the rights of that user. LBAC allows administrators to rapidly set up and enforce permission policies for users by assigning them to user groups and granting or revoking access to resources for that group. LBAC provides administrators with fine-grained control, allowing them to specify user access rights to resources that would otherwise be too difficult or undesirable to control. LBAC also allows administrators to easily enforce least privilege and time-sensitive access policies, and provides an audit trail to help track user activity. LBAC is a critical part of any organizations’ defense against data breaches and cyber attacks."
Loadable Kernel Modules (LKM),"Loadable Kernel Modules, referred to as LKMs, are pieces of kernel code that can be loaded into and unloaded from the kernel, at runtime. LKMs are objects that may be used to extend the functionality of the Linux operating system. They are typically used to add device drivers or to extend the functionality of existing device drivers. LKMs are useful for adding support for a new device, or for customizing the behavior of a device, without having to modify the Linux kernel code and recompile the kernel. They are also useful for debugging and troubleshooting device driver issues. LKMs are written in C and must be compiled with the Linux kernel's source code, along with a set of kernel headers."

It is the basic building block of any digital system. It can be used to construct complex logic systems such as arithmetic circuits, relational circuits, multiplexers, decoders, and state machines. Logic gates are classified into two categories: combinational logic gates and sequential logic gates. Combinational logic gates perform logical operations on the inputs to generate output without any memory, while sequential logic gates use moments to store data and time to determine the output. Logic gates can be designed using transistors, diodes, and other electrical components."
Look-Back (Look-Back Review),"Look-Back is a process of reviewing financial transactions at a later date to ensure compliance with laws and regulations regarding money laundering. Organizations use this process to check for suspicious activity that may have been missed when the original transaction was completed. In addition, they use Look-Backs to assess the effectiveness of their anti-money laundering controls, identify any weaknesses, and strengthen those areas. This process helps organizations to detect and prevent money laundering activities and protect customers’ funds."
Loopback Address,"A loopback address is a type of IP address used to route messages back to the same computer sending them. It is a special type of IP address, usually in the form of 127.0.0.1, that is used to refer to the same computer or device on a network. Loopback addresses are not reachable from other computers or devices on a network and are most often used for software debugging, routing, and loop prevention. Additionally, loopback addresses are used as a way of testing network applications by sending requests and receiving replies locally. For example, a web application on a server can be tested by making a loopback request to itself to ensure that the server is working properly. All networks, including virtual networks, use loopback addresses."
Lottery Scam,"A Lottery Scam is an attempted fraud in which a scammer falsely advises a victim that they have won a lottery prize, and subsequently attempts to extort money from the victim for ""processing fees"" or similar. Generally, the scammer will try to claim that their victim has won some large sum of money in a lottery draw, but that in order to receive the prize they have to pay a fee or other charges. They may also try to ask the victim to reveal personal financial information such as bank account details in order to facilitate transfer of the prize. In all cases, the victim does not actually receive any winnings at all and is simply tricked into giving away their money or financial details."
Loyalty Points Fraud,"Loyalty points fraud refers to the intentional abuse of loyalty reward program points within an organization. It involves the theft or fraudulently gained control of loyalty points, either from within the organization or from outside sources or hackers. This type of fraud requires an understanding of the policies and procedures associated with organizations' loyalty points program, as well as a knowledge of the fraud techniques employed to exploit the system.

Advanced technologies and solutions such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help in detecting and blocking malware, along with educating users on cyber security and security best practices."
Man-In-The-Browser,"Man-In-The-Browser (MITB) is a type of Trojan Horse malware attack in which remote malicious code is inserted into a web application’s browser, allowing a criminal to intercept, modify, and redirect credit card payments and other sensitive information. MITB works by injecting malicious script into a browser’s web traffic that may include keystroke logging, enabling the remote attacker to gain access to bank accounts and credit card information. While the user may not be able to detect the malicious code, it can be used to change the data that is passed between the browser and the web application. This type of sophisticated attack is difficult to detect and can be used to steal confidential information or perform unauthorized transactions. It is therefore essential that organizations have adequate security measures in place to protect against such cyber threats."
Man-In-The-Middle,"The term Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) is applied to a type of attack that exploits a vulnerability in a communication system, whereby the attacker gains control of the communication among two legitimate parties, allowing them to capture and alter data sent through the communication channel. The MITM attack interposes itself between the two legitimate parties, allowing the attacker to ""eavesdrop"" on the communication, intercept and modify data, or even impersonate one of the involved parties. This type of attack is especially dangerous because it can remain undetected and can be used to access sensitive data, redirect funds, or take over user accounts. MITM attacks can be mitigated by utilizing encryption protocols, secure channels for data transfers, and ensuring all communication is sent through verified sources."
Man İn The Middle Attack,"A Man in the Middle Attack (MITM) is a type of cyber attack that occurs when a malicious actor infiltrates a communications session between two or more parties. The malicious actor inserts themselves into the session, allowing them to eavesdrop, manipulate or disrupt communications. MITM attacks can occur on both wired and wireless networks and are enabled by weaknesses in the underlying protocols or by latching onto unencrypted data. The goal of these attacks is usually to steal data, monitor activities, or hijack accounts. To mitigate against MITM attacks, organizations and users should follow best security practices such as encryption and authentication, as well as using up-to-date security software."
Mandatory Access Control (MAC),"Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is a security system designed to restrict user access to data or resources by enforcing a predetermined set of rules based on an individual user's clearance level and category of data. It is commonly used in government and military organizations, where a hierarchy of users is established and there is an explicit need to control access to sensitive information. By assigning labels to both data and users and using these labels to specify access rights, MAC is able to regulate the flow of data between objects. It is most effective when employed in concert with other security methods, such as cryptography, to ensure complete integrity of confidential data."
Mandatory Sanctions Lists,"Mandatory Sanctions Lists are lists of individuals, entities, and organizations that have been designated by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and the United Nations Security Council Sanctions Committee as associated with terrorists, organized crime, weapons of mass destruction, or other nefarious activities. It is illegal for any person, company, or entity to make any form of financial transaction with these individuals, entities, or organizations. Anti-money laundering experts must be aware of these lists and ensure that their clients or companies do not make any transactions with any entities on the lists. Failing to do so can result in criminal penalties and heavy fines."
Marketplace Fraud,"Marketplace Fraud involves the use of digital platforms (such as websites, mobile applications or social media) to commit fraudulent activities. Examples of types of Marketplace Fraud include phishing scams, account takeovers, fake accounts, payment fraud, auction fraud and product counterfeiting. These scams can result in financial losses, compromised customer information, reputational damage and the legal implications of being involved in fraudulent activities. Organizations must have measures in place to detect, investigate and prevent Marketplace Fraud. This includes strategies for transaction monitoring, user authentication, and proactive tools to detect and prevent fraud before it occurs. Additionally, organizations must stay up-to-date on cyber security best practices, fraud prevention methods and emerging trends in fraud to keep their customer's data and finances safe."
Masquerade Attack,"A masquerade attack is a type of security breach that occurs when an attacker impersonates a legitimate user or service via stolen credentials or network spoofing. Specifically, the attacker poses as a trusted user to gain access to security-protected systems or data. This type of attack is incredibly difficult to detect, as the intruder appears to be a trusted user. This makes masquerade attacks a major security vulnerability, as attackers can easily gain access to confidential information, data, and applications. They can also use the stolen credentials to launch malicious activities, such as modifying or deleting data. Additionally, it’s difficult to prove that the attacker had malicious intent, as the credentials may have been shared with legitimate users. Organizations must implement strong authentication systems, monitor user activity, and educate users on the dangers of masquerade attacks to maintain strong security."

To ensure protection, organizations must ensure that mobile technologies are updated and patched regularly to prevent attacks and breaches."
Money Laundering,"Money laundering is a process of disguising illegal profits or funds obtained from criminal activities such as drug trafficking, corruption, terrorism, or other financial crimes. It involves moving money between different accounts or entities so as to hide its criminal origins. Money laundering typically has three stages: placement, layering, and integration. In the placement stage, criminals try to place their illicit proceeds into the financial system. Layering is the process of obscuring the audit trail by moving funds through multiple accounts. The integration stage is where the money is put into a legitimate stream after laundering and is available for use. Common methods of Money laundering include offshore banking, shell companies, and false invoicing."
Money Laundering Phases,"Money Laundering is the process of disguising illicitly obtained funds or assets to make them appear as legitimate income. It involves three distinct phases. The first phase is placement, during which illicit funds are introduced into the financial system. This is often done through methods such as making cash deposits or using cash to purchase assets. The second phase is layering, where the funds are moved around using complex financial transactions to further conceal the origin of the funds. The third phase is integration, where the funds are placed in legitimate businesses or investments to create a legitimate source of income. Money laundering has been used to fund criminal activities such as terrorist attacks, drug trafficking, and bribery."
Money Laundering Regulations,"Money laundering is defined as the process of disguising the proceeds of criminal activity to make them appear as if they are legitimate. It involves disguising the source of criminal proceeds, typically by passing money through a series of transactions and companies to hide the ownership and control of funds. Money laundering regulations are in place to ensure that all financial activities are tracked, monitored and reported to the appropriate authorities. Money laundering regulations require institutions and individuals to report suspicious activities and transactions, implement anti-money laundering compliance programs, and implement customer due diligence procedures. These regulations are in place to prevent the use of the financial system for illegal activities and to protect the integrity of the financial system."
Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO),"A Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) is an individual with the responsibility of overseeing and maintaining a company's anti-money laundering compliance program. The MLRO is typically appointed by a business's senior management, and is usually either a legal professional, or a senior executive in the company. The MLRO is responsible for monitoring and reporting any suspicious activities that might be related to money laundering. This involves identifying, assessing, and reporting any suspicious activities, as well as implementing systems and procedures to ensure that the company's compliance program is effective. The MLRO must have a thorough understanding of relevant legislation and regulations, and must also be able to develop and maintain effective relationships with external organizations such as law enforcement and regulatory authorities."
Money Mules,"Money mules are people or organizations who are used unwittingly to transfer stolen funds or funds that originate from malicious activities, such as scams or fraud. Money mules typically have established bank accounts, which they use to receive stolen funds that appear in their accounts without any suspicion as to where it came from. The mules then withdraw the money or transfer it to another account. This type of activity is often associated with organized crime, and can result in legal repercussions for the participants. Money mules can also be utilized in internet fraud, where stolen funds are routed from one account to another in an effort to avoid detection."
Money Remitters,"Money remitters are a type of financial service provider that facilitate the transfer of funds between two or more parties without relying on a traditional banking institution. They provide a faster, and often more cost-effective way of moving money, usually from a sender to a receiver in another country. Money remitters may be individuals or businesses, but are typically regulated by the relevant financial authority and must adhere to strict requirements such as submission of required compliance documents before being able to offer these services. Money remitters are also expected to actively monitor their client's transactions and report any suspicious activity to the appropriate anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing authorities."
Money Services Business (MSB),"A Money Services Business (MSB) is a business that provides customers with financial services such as money transmission, currency exchange, check cashing, and the sale of prepaid access that lets customers store funds or purchase goods and services. MSBs are regulated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and must adhere to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. MSB customers must be identified, verified and monitored to ensure compliance with all applicable laws. MSBs must also establish, maintain, and update policies, procedures and internal controls for detecting, monitoring, and reporting suspicious activity."
Money Transfer Service Or Value Transfer Service,"Money Transfer Service (MTS), also known as Value Transfer Service (VTS), is a service used to transfer funds between individuals, groups, or organizations. The service facilitates the movement of funds, often through third-party companies, typically without the use of a banking system. It is used by a variety of individuals and entities including businesses, government, international organizations, and individuals. Money Transfer Services can be used for a variety of purposes, such as transferring money from one party to another, transferring wages, remitting money from a foreign country, emergency payments, or even for charity. Money Transfer Services are highly regulated and are strictly monitored for any suspicious transactions, as they may be used to launder money illegally."
Moneyval,"Moneyval is an acronym for the Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of Terrorism. It is a monitoring body of the Council of Europe, composed of independent experts from 30 European countries. Moneyval evaluates and monitors the implementation of anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism measures in the countries it oversees. It assesses the effectiveness of the legal, institutional and operational frameworks in place to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Moneyval also provides technical assistance and guidance to countries in need of implementation, improvement or enforcement of their anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) frameworks."
Monitoring,"Monitoring is a critical component of an anti-money laundering program. It involves an ongoing effort to detect and report any suspicious activity that may indicate money laundering or other financial crimes. This includes regular reviews of customer records, transactions and financial activities for signs of suspicious activities. It also includes maintaining records and filing reports to the relevant government agencies in accordance with local regulations. Monitoring activities also involve identifying and responding to any new money laundering threats and trends, as well as educating staff on current laws, regulations, and best practices."
Monoculture,"Monoculture is a cyber security term that describes the prevalence of certain operating systems, software, or other technology within an organization or system. Monoculture can occur due to the lack of diversity in technology stacks; when the same types of operating systems, software, or other technology are used across an organization or system, it makes them more susceptible to attack. Monoculture poses a security threat as any type of vulnerability or attack would affect all components of a system that are part of this monoculture. By having a diverse set of components, an attack would be limited to only one part of the system and not the entire system. Therefore, organizations must strive to create a technology stack that incorporates elements from multiple vendors, operating systems, and software versions to reduce the risk of monocultures and the potential damage they could cause."
Morris Worm,"The Morris Worm was a computer worm created in 1988 by Robert Tappan Morris, a graduate student at Cornell University. It was the first computer worm to be released into the wild, and the first to spread through the internet. The Morris Worm was capable of rapidly replicating itself, using remote computers to copy itself and spread further. The worm was released on November 2, 1988, and caused widespread disruption throughout the early internet, as it was not designed to cause malicious damage. The Morris Worm was able to exploit various vulnerabilities in the computer systems of that time, such as weak usernames and passwords, as well as weak system configurations. It was also able to take advantage of the fact that many computers were connected to the internet with little or no security. The Morris Worm was eventually contained, but the incident ultimately resulted in increased awareness of the need for increased security measures on computers connected to the internet."
Mortgage fraud,"Mortgage fraud is a type of financial fraud that involves misrepresenting information or making false statements related to a mortgage loan. It could be done by a borrower, a property appraiser, a closing agent, or a lender. It typically involves overstating one's income or assets, lying about employment, listing fake or exaggerated debts, or submitting false or forged documents. Mortgage fraud can be motivated by the aim to illegally obtain financing or to receive a larger loan amount than what was originally qualified for. The most frequent type of mortgage fraud is loan origination fraud, which usually involves the borrower or loan officer lying about the loan terms or application information. Mortgage fraud can result in costly penalties and legal repercussions."
Mousetrapping,"Mousetrapping is a type of cyber scam where malicious individuals deceive victims into clicking on a malicious link or entering personal information into a malicious website. This practice is one of the most common online scams and is used to capture victims' confidential information such as credit card numbers, passwords and other confidential data. When a victim clicks on a malicious link or provides information to a malicious website, the malicious actor gains access to the victim's computer and uses it to deploy malware and malicious files. Mousetrapping is often used by hackers as part of a greater effort to exploit potential victims, create fraudulent identities and conduct illegal activities such as identity theft, financial fraud and cyber theft."
Multi-Cast,"Multi-cast is a networking technology that enables one source of data to be sent to multiple recipients simultaneously. This technology requires the use of dedicated protocols such as Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM) to make it possible. Multi-cast is a popular technology used by businesses and organizations that require data to be sent to multiple locations with a single transmission. By enabling fewer transmissions and requiring less bandwidth, multicast can greatly increase the efficiency of network resources while reducing the costs associated with network usage. Additionally, multicast can secure data transmissions by providing authentication, preventing unauthorized access to data, and ensuring privacy."
Multi-Factor Authentication,"Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is an authentication methodology that requires users to provide multiple pieces of authentication evidence when logging into a system. This evidence can come from a combination of factors, such as something that the user possesses (like a device or token), something that the user knows (like a username or password), or something that identifies the user (like a biometric identifier, like a fingerprint). MFA is designed to make authentication more secure, since a user must provide multiple pieces of authentication evidence that is harder for a cybercriminal to obtain or spoof."
Multi-Homed,"A Multi-Homed Network is a type of network architecture which uses multiple Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or network vendors to provide redundant network connections and additional bandwidth to an organization. It is used by organizations to offer a reliable, secure and resilient network infrastructure with redundancy. The Multi-homed network architecture includes a private Local Area Network (LAN) or Wide Area Network (WAN) which is connected to multiple redundant ISPs or vendors. A router or a firewall is used to manage the incoming and outgoing traffic and the routing protocols used are BGP or OSPF. This provides a secure, reliable and fault-tolerant network infrastructure with a high degree of network availability and scalability."
Multi-Jurisdictional Investigations,"Multi-jurisdictional investigations are a type of financial investigation that involve multiple countries and jurisdictions to uncover financial crimes. This is especially relevant in cases of money laundering, since money launderers often move funds through multiple jurisdictions. These investigations involve collaboration and coordination between law enforcement and hundreds of financial institutions across the world to identify, trace, and seize illegally obtained funds. Additionally, international organizations, such as the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank are often involved in multi-jurisdictional investigations to ensure that all jurisdictions are working in unison to combat financial crime."
Multilateral Sanctions,"Multilateral sanctions are international restrictions imposed on an entity or country by a number of countries, rather than just one country. These sanctions can be imposed for a variety of reasons, including political, economic, or military reasons. These sanctions are often referred to as “robust” because they are much more difficult to bypass or evade than unilateral sanctions imposed by a single country. Multilateral sanctions can include asset freezes, travel bans, trade restrictions, or other economic measures. These measures are aimed at punishing and deterring entities or countries from engaging in activities deemed to be a threat to international security, such as money laundering or funding terrorism. Multilateral sanctions are an important tool in the fight against organized crime and the illegal financing of terrorist activities."
Multiplexing,"Multiplexing is a process in data communication technology that allows many different types of data to be transmitted simultaneously over a single communication line. It is often used in telecommunications networks and computer networks because it allows for efficient use of transmission bandwidth and allows multiple data streams to share the same communication resources more effectively. It works by multiplexing multiple incoming data signals into a single outgoing data signal. This can be done in two ways, time-division multiplexing (TDM) or frequency-division multiplexing (FDM). In TDM, multiple data signals are divided into packets of information that are sent sequentially over a single communication line. In FDM, multiple data signals are divided into different frequency bands and are sent over the same communication line simultaneously. Multiplexing can be used to increase the data capacity of a single communication line, improve data latency, and increase data transfer rate."
Mutual Evaluation Report (MER),"A Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) is a comprehensive assessment of a country's level of compliance with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidelines. The report is produced by an assessor country and provided to the FATF to evaluate a jurisdiction's anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) system. The MER is based on an in-depth review of the jurisdiction’s legal framework, financial sectors, and other relevant sectors, and the effectiveness of their AML/CTF measures. The MER also provides the country with feedback and recommendations to help them improve their AML/CTF measures. The report is an important tool in helping countries identify weaknesses in their AML/CTF regimes and take appropriate action."
Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT),A Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) is an agreement between two or more states to provide mutual legal assistance in the investigation and prosecution of criminal activity. It allows for the exchange of evidence and other forms of cooperation between the states in order to bring criminals to justice. A MLAT also allows for international cooperation in anti-money laundering and other financial crimes. This type of agreement is essential for the effective prosecution of cross-border crimes and the prevention of money laundering.
Name Screening,"Name Screening is a process used to identify and assess the risk of individuals and entities being involved in money laundering activities. It involves comparing a customer's information against various lists of entities and individuals that are known to be problematic. This process is important in an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program to ensure that customers and counterparties are not being used to facilitate money laundering activities. Name Screening includes both internal lists of prohibitive entities, such as Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), and external lists from sources such as the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). By screening customer names, AML experts can identify individuals or entities that may be involved in money laundering and take appropriate actions to address their risk."
Naming Conventions,"Naming conventions are formal guidelines that help organizations ensure that documents and data can be easily identified and organized. They help ensure that data is named in a consistent and uniform way, using a standard system. Naming conventions often include rules for the length of data files or databases, the types of characters allowed in the name, and the order of words used in the name. Naming conventions help organizations prevent data loss, confusion, and duplicate data, as well as facilitate ease of access and retrieval. Ultimately, they ensure that data is organized and named in a way that is easy to understand and maintain."
Nat,"Network Address Translation (NAT) is a protocol used in computer networks to map a public IP address to a private IP address. It converts packets sent from the private IP address to the public IP, allowing communication between two computers on the same network, but with different IP addresses. NAT is used for various reasons such as increasing network security, reducing IP address exhaustion and conserving public IP addresses. It also provides a way for users to connect to the internet without having to purchase a publicly routable IP address from their service provider. NAT is secure because it makes it difficult for outside computers to detect the internal IP addresses. NAT technology is used in many wireless networks and VPNs to create a secure connection between internet users."

Natural Disaster,"A natural disaster is an event (such as a hurricane, tornado, flood, earthquake, or wildfire) that involves a natural process, and results in adverse effects to the environment, property, and lives of those affected. Natural disasters can be caused by a variety of physical and chemical processes, including floods from excessive rainfall, landslides from earthquakes, and wildfires from extreme heat and drought. Natural disasters can also have economic and social impacts, as they disrupt normal activities, and cause long-term stress and economic loss. As a cybersecurity expert, I understand that natural disasters can create pathways for cyber attack, as they disrupt normal Cybersecurity measures and can cause wide spread system outages. It is important to have a plan in place to protect businesses and individuals from natural disasters and the associated cyber-security risks."
Nested Account,"Nested accounts are a type of financial activity used to obscure the true source of funds by transferring money between multiple accounts. This is done by using one account to transfer money to another account, and then transferring the money from the second account to a third account, and so on. This nesting of accounts makes it difficult to track the source of funds or to identify who is the ultimate beneficiary of the funds. It is a form of money laundering used to disguise the true origin and ownership of funds."
Nesting,"Nesting is a type of money laundering scheme which works by concealing the origin of the illegal funds by transferring the funds through multiple intermediary transactions. A common method of nesting is to use multiple layers of complex transactions to break up large sums of money. Funds are sent on circuitous routes, through multiple bank accounts or entities, to make it difficult to track the origins of the money. This technique is also known as layering, and is often used in combination with using offshore accounts to further obfuscate the source of the funds."
Netmask,"Netmask is a network tool used to define the network range of an IP address. It is a bitmask that is used to break up an IP address into the network and host segments. The network portion of the IP address indicates the network and subnet the host belongs to, while the host portion identifies the particular device within the given network. In IPv4, a netmask consists of 4 bytes (8 bits each), typically written in the form of 4 octets in the format 255.255.255.0. A netmask of 255.255.255.0 allows for up to 256 unique IP addresses in the network. Netmask is important in network and internet security as it helps to determine which computers have access to each other, and which networks they can communicate with."
Network Access Control,"Network Access Control (NAC) is a security solution that helps regulate access to a network by monitoring and controlling the user’s access to network resources. This process generally requires user authentication to verify the user’s identity and authorization to validate the user’s permissions. NAC also can enforce policy compliance by monitoring the user’s system configuration, including software updates and anti-virus/anti-malware applications. By using NAC, organizations can reduce the risk of unauthorized access, malware, and data theft. It also helps organizations meet compliance and regulatory requirements. NAC solutions can include a firewall, Virtual Private Network (VPN) or Remote Access Services (RAS). NAC security solutions provide a comprehensive view of the user’s system and classify the user’s access accordingly to grant them appropriate access to the network."
Network Address Translation,"Network Address Translation (NAT) is the process of a network device, such as a firewall or router, taking one or more internal IP addresses and translating them into external IP addresses. This is done in order to provide a unique external IP address to the internal network, while maintaining the same internal network configuration. By using NAT, the firewall or router can hide the internal IP addresses from the external network, thus providing a level of protection and security to the internal network. Additionally, NAT can be useful for conserving public IP addresses, as multiple internal systems can use the same public IP address. NAT can be configured in both software and hardware depending on the security requirements of the internal network."

Neural networks learn by breaking down complex problems into simpler tasks, making it easier to find solutions. Neural networks can be used for classification, detection and forecasting tasks in industries such as finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. They are also helpful in helping to detect fraud, malware, and other forms of cyber-attacks. Neural networks have the capability of improving themselves as more data is fed in, as they are able to create more accurate and reliable results as data is gradually accumulated."
Nominee Director Or Shareholder,"A Nominee Director or Shareholder is an individual or entity appointed by a third party to act on its behalf in the management and/or ownership of a company. This arrangement allows the third party to remain anonymous and limits their potential liability and exposure to regulators. As an Anti-Money Laundering Expert, it is important to identify when a nominee may be involved in a corporate structure, as this may indicate a possible money laundering risk. This means developing a strong understanding of the underlying beneficial owners, their roles and responsibilities in the company, and the potential risks associated with their involvement."
Non-Governmental Organization (NGO),"A Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) is a non-profit organization that is typically independent from government and often works on local, regional or international development initiatives, such as providing aid to vulnerable populations or supporting environmental causes. NGOs are typically funded by a variety of sources, such as private donors, government grants, foundations, or corporate sponsorships. NGOs are held to the same standard as other organizations when it comes to anti-money laundering regulations, and they are required to take active steps to ensure their funds are not being used for criminal activities."
Non-Profit Organizations (NPO),"Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) are entities that are formed and operated to pursue a charitable, educational, religious, literary or scientific purpose. They typically have a mission and purpose that benefits the public good, rather than generating profits for private interests. NPOs typically generate their income from donations, grants, and fees for services they provide. NPOs are not typically subject to taxation as long as they adhere to all applicable regulations and operate in accordance with their stated mission and purpose. NPOs have a responsibility to act in the public interest, be accountable and transparent in their activities, and must avoid conflicted interests or activities that are not in line with their mission and purpose."
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT),"The Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is an international treaty aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology. It was signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union (now Russia) in 1968 and entered into force in 1970. The treaty is the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime, and applies to all states, regardless of whether they possess nuclear weapons or not. Under the terms of the NPT, non-nuclear weapon states undertake not to acquire, develop, or transfer nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, while nuclear weapon states agree to not transfer nuclear weapons or other forms of nuclear explosive devices to non-nuclear weapon states. Additionally, all states-parties must cooperate in the peaceful use of nuclear energy."
Non-Repudiation,"Non-repudiation is a key concept in cyber security. It is a security measure that prevents a sender or receiver of information from denying that they sent or received specific data. This is useful because it allows for a digital chain of evidence to be established and maintained, as well as proving that certain digital information has not been tampered with. Non-repudiation is commonly used in digital contracts, digital forensics, and digital certificates in order to verify the authenticity of documents. It is also useful in digital transactions, as it allows the recipient of funds to prove that funds were received. Non-repudiation can be implemented by implementing digital signatures, cryptographic methods, or timestamping."
Null Session,"Null Session is a networking protocol where a user can access remote network shares or IPC (Inter-Process Communication) resources without providing any credentials. It is mainly used by system administrators in order to connect to machines on the network, or by hackers to gain access to sensitive information. Null Sessions have been used to exploit Windows systems in the past, by being used to access shadow passwords and other sensitive information. To prevent these user sessions from being used for malicious purposes, administrators should disable null sessions on their network, or thoroughly monitor user logins. Other measures such as using secure passwords and other authentication methods can also help."

It is a self-hosted solution that is managed on the business’s servers, computers, or other hardware, as opposed to hosted in the cloud. On-premise software is best suited for businesses that require a complex and high performance system, or have very specific security or compliance requirements. Benefits of on-premise software include greater control, improved security, better performance, and easier customization. Additionally, on-premise software is typically more cost effective in the long term than software hosted in the cloud due to the savings in server maintenance and hosting costs."
One-time Password,"A One-Time Password (OTP) is a type of authentication that is used to verify the identity of the user of a service. It is a unique, temporary password that is generated and sent to the user during a transaction. The user must then enter the OTP to verify their identity before the transaction can be completed. OTPs are designed to be used only once to prevent unauthorized access and are usually time-sensitive. The most common use of OTPs is for banking transactions, but they can also be used in online shopping, two-factor authentication, and other areas where an extra layer of security is needed. OTPs are typically sent via email, SMS message, or an authenticating app, and are often combined with other security measures, such as biometrics, to increase security."
One-Way Encryption,"One-way encryption, also known as a one-way hash function, is a type of cryptography that is irreversible. It is used to ensure the security and integrity of data, as the encrypted data cannot be decrypted back to its original form. This allows for sensitive information such as passwords and banking credentials to be securely stored in a database. With one-way encryption, the only way to access the original data is by knowing the key used to encrypt it. Without the key, the data is permanently in a hashed form, making it impossible to decrypt. This type of encryption also provides a way to verify data integrity, as any changes to the data will result in a different encrypted output."
One-Way Function,"A one-way function is a mathematical function that is easy to compute for any given input, but that produces a unique output that is difficult, if not impossible, to reverse back to the input given only the output. In other words, it is impossible or impossible to predict the input if you know the output. This type of one-way function is used in many areas of cryptography, digital signatures and other security tasks, as it ensures that the original input remains protected and secure. The most common example of a one-way function is the hash function, which takes any input and produces a unique output of a fixed length by changing the input. This makes it impossible to guess the input given only the output of the hash function."
Open Authorization,"Open Authorization (OAuth) is a secure authorization and authentication protocol that enables users to authorize third-party applications to access their data without requiring them to share their passwords. It is an open standard since 2010 which provides a secure communication channel between a client and a server. It is widely adopted across the internet as a way to enable secure access to online services. OAuth works by giving users a token instead of a password, allowing users to securely authenticate with their credentials without sacrificing account security. By authorizing applications through OAuth, users can control exactly which data and services the applications can access on their behalf. This provides a secure, efficient, and user-friendly way to authorize third-party applications."
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF),"Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is an interior gateway protocol (IGP) for routing IP packets within a single autonomous system, such as a network. It is a link-state protocol, which means it uses the concept of cost or metric to determine the best path for a packet based on its characteristics. OSPF operates by sending periodic link-state advertisements (LSAs) out to all known hosts and routers on a network. Each LSA contains information about the router’s neighbors, as well as a path cost or metric for each link. Then, the OSPF uses a shortest path first algorithm to calculate the shortest path from source to destination and builds the routing table accordingly. OSPF is regarded as one of the most reliable and secure routing protocols for IP networks."

These criminals may use false identities and misrepresent themselves as being an authentic debt collection agency or government agency. They can be very convincing and prey on vulnerable individuals who may perceive a debt to be legitimate. It is important for victims to be aware of their rights and be mindful of who they are speaking to. Victims should not give away any personal information or make payments without verifying the debt is real. Victims should also report any suspicious activity to the authorities."
Pharming,"Pharming is a type of cyberattack that targets a computer or network by redirecting traffic away from legitimate websites to malicious ones. Attackers employ various methods to carry out pharming, including manipulating the Domain Name System, exploiting known security vulnerabilities in popular web browsers, or infecting computers with malicious software. These methods can be used to redirect visitors to phishing sites, collect sensitive data, or launch further attacks. To protect against pharming attacks, it is important to keep all software up to date and practice good online safety procedures, such as using strong passwords and not entering sensitive information on unknown websites."
Pharming Attack,"Pharming is a cyber attack that attempts to redirect traffic from a legitimate website to a malicious one, by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Domain Name System (DNS) lookup process. When successful, it can enable hackers to steal confidential data, including user login and transaction details, by redirecting users to malicious websites or pages that look identical to legitimate ones. It is becoming increasingly common, as phishing attacks become more sophisticated and attackers gain access to multiple points on the DNS chain. As such, companies should take steps to protect their infrastructure and user accounts from pharming attacks. This can include using secure protocols, implementing multi-factor authentication and regularly monitoring their DNS records."
Phishing,"Phishing is a type of cyberattack that utilizes social engineering techniques to deceive victims into disclosing sensitive personal and financial information or performing tasks that allow the attacker access to a victim’s system. It typically occurs when attackers disguise themselves as a trusted source, such as a bank or online retailer, in order to steal personal information or financial data. The attack process begins with a malicious email, often with a “bait” message attached, that contains a malicious link or a downloadable file. Victims may be tricked into providing confidential login details or other sensitive data by clicking on the link or downloading the file. Other techniques for phishing include skimming, which involves the installation of a malicious code that captures information at the point of transaction, and key-logging, which involves capturing the keystrokes entered into a computer."
Phishing and Pharming,"Phishing is a type of cybercrime technique used by hackers to obtain personal information such as login credentials and credit card numbers. It typically involves the use of an online form or email that looks legitimate but is actually a fake which requests the targeted victims to enter their sensitive data in order to gain access. Pharming is a more advanced form of Phishing where hackers use malicious code to redirect users to fake websites. This code can be deliberately uploaded to a website, or can be inserted into a link or URL address. By redirecting users to malicious websites, hackers can steal user data and other confidential information."
Phishing Kit,"Phishing kits are malicious tools used by cybercriminals to deceive people into providing sensitive personal or financial information, such as passwords and credit card numbers. To create a phishing campaign, the attacker uses a kit to construct a legitimate-looking but fraudulent website, often designed to imitate a familiar banking or corporate site. The kit also contains code to collect submitted data and pass it onto the attacker. The attacker may also use the kit to create deceptive emails to lure victims to the spoofed website. Phishing kits are typically sold on dark web marketplaces and can be easily bought and customized with minimal coding knowledge. It’s important to stay vigilant and continue to practice good cyber security habits to reduce the likelihood of falling victim to these malicious attacks."
Phishing Schemes,"Phishing Schemes involve criminals using emails, texts and malicious websites to impersonate legitimate organizations in order to steal sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers and banking information. The criminals usually lure the victims in by offering suspicious links, fake offers and bogus contests. The best way to protect yourself from becoming a victim of this type of scam is to be aware of phishing schemes, research unfamiliar organizations and refrain from clicking unknown links. If the request seems suspicious then do not respond, instead contact the originator via known trusted methods. Also, be sure to use strong passwords, two factor authentication and keep your system and data up to date with the latest security patches."
Phone Verification,"Phone Verification is a process of confirming the identity of an individual by means of identifying the phone number associated with that individual. It is commonly used for two-factor authentication, which is the addition of an extra layer of security in order to better protect sensitive information. This process works by first obtaining the phone number associated with the person and then following up with a phone call or text message containing a one-time authentication code. The user is then asked to turn and offer the authentication code in order to gain access to the system and prove that they are allowed to proceed. This helps to keep malicious actors away from personal data and reduce the risk of data breaches."
Ping Of Death,"Ping of Death is a type of computer security exploit. It is an attack in which a malicious user sends a computer a single ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packet that is larger in size than the maximum allowable size of 65,535 bytes. When this occurs, the receiving system is unable to handle the packet and crashes or hangs, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. To protect against this attack, security professionals must ensure that the servers, firewalls, and network devices are configured properly to not allow oversized packets to get through. Additionally, administrators can protect their networks by implementing additional security measures such as packet filtering and intrusion detection systems."
Ping Scan,"Ping scan is a type of network scan commonly used in cybersecurity. It works by sending a special type of IP packets called ICMP Echo Requests to a range of target IP addresses in order to determine which of them are reachable and operational. If the target responds with an ICMP Echo Reply, the scan indicates that the device is online and accessible. This information can then used to identify and assess the security posture of the target systems. The ping scan is used to gain an overview of the network and identify which systems are active, as well as detect reachable networks and hosts that might be vulnerable to attacks."
Ping Sweep,"A ping sweep is a technique used in information security to identify live hosts on a network. It involves sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo requests, also known as pings, to an entire network range and then listening for responses. Responses received indicate that systems are present on the network and can be further investigated for vulnerabilities or other suspicious activity. Ping sweeps are a form of network discovery and can help identify unauthorized hosts on a network. It is important to note that ping sweeps can also be used by malicious actors to detect vulnerable systems on a network, making it important to properly secure networks against pings and other potential scans."
Plagiarism,"Plagiarism is the act of taking someone else's work or idea and using it as your own without giving proper credit or permission to the original source. It can occur in any form of media, including writing, artwork, music, photography, and video. It’s a type of intellectual theft that can result in criminal or civil penalties. Plagiarism damages the credibility and integrity of those involved while negatively affecting the author or creator of the original work. Plagiarism is a serious offense that is punishable by law, including penalties such as fines, lawsuits, and even possible jail time. It’s important to understand plagiarism and how to properly cite sources of information used."
Plaintext,"Plaintext is a type of data that has not been encrypted. Plaintext is in its original form, meaning that it is not encoded or altered in any way. It is a data format that is widely used in electronic communications and can be easily read by both humans and machines. Plaintext is sent over a network or stored in a computer file without being encrypted. Although plaintext is often a security risk, as it can be easily intercepted and read by malicious actors, it is often used as a starting point for cryptographic operations, such as encryption and digital signing. In such cases where plaintext is used as input, it is essential that the data is handled securely and that proper security measures are in place to protect it."

It is used to encrypt the data between two points, typically between the customer’s computer and the merchant’s server. P2PE prevents data breaches by shielding the cardholder’s information and other confidential data as it flows over public networks such as the internet. P2PE packages the data into an encrypted packet, which prevents unauthorized access by any third-party. Once the data reaches its intended destination, it is decrypted using an approved decryption method. P2PE is an important security measure to prevent payment card fraud and data theft and is commonly used in e-commerce transactions."
Point-To-Point Protocol (PPP),"Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is a layer 2 data link protocol that is widely used to establish connections between two nodes over a physical serial connection. PPP is used to exchange data and manipulate link layer control information across two nodes, such as network identification (authentication) and configuration options. PPP is designed to enable communication between two nodes over a point-to-point link and provide reliable high-speed transmission of data over physical media such as modem, ISDN, or DSL. PPP is normally used as the data link protocol for connecting to the internet, dial-up situations, or serial tunnels. It can also be used for Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for more secure transmissions. PPP supports several different link layer control protocols that provide integrity checks and basic authentication of the peer node."
Point-To-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP),"Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is a type of Virtual Private Network (VPN) that uses a secure connection to facilitate the transfer of data between two remote computers over the internet. It provides strong encryption, authentication and data integrity to ensure secure data communication. It also helps to hide the IP address of the sending computer from the receiving computer. This makes it ideal for secure data transfer, such as sending sensitive files between two computers or for accessing a restricted network such as a corporate intranet from outside the company's network. It can also be used to bypass internet censorship for uncensored access to the internet."
Poison Reverse,"Poison Reverse is a routing technique used to prevent routing loops in a network. It is a tool in which routers inject information about paths to destination networks, as well as direction, as part of their routing update into the network, so that if a path becomes invalid, the routers can then use the information to contact the router from which the original advertisement was received and update the path or remove it from the routing table. The main goal of Poison Reverse is to prevent routing loops in a network. It works by having routers advertise an invalid route so that other routers in the network can detect the route and prevent it from being used."
Policy Management,"Policy Management is the practice of creating, updating, and enforcing rules and regulations to ensure the safety and security of a given system or network. It involves determining the scope and objectives of a security policy, identifying threats and vulnerabilities, and assessing the risk associated with them. A well-defined policy allows organizations to stay informed and compliant with security best practices while also helping ensure the integrity of the network. A good policy management system encourages user accountability, reduces the chances of malicious attacks, and ensures data confidentiality. Finally, it is essential for organizations to regularly review, validate, and update their policies to ensure the system is secure and able to respond quickly to new threats."
Policy Violation,"Policy violation is an act that disregards and goes beyond accepted policies and guidelines imposed by an organization, government, or other entity. It can range from small missteps to major offenses and can lead to considerable consequences. A policy violation can be unintentional, or done deliberately as a malicious act. Some of the potential effects of a policy violation may include suspension of privileges, fines, disbarment, or even incarceration. In the cyber security and fraud prevention fields, a policy violation often refers to an individual gaining access to systems, programs, or other information they are unauthorized to access or manipulate, or performing any prohibited action in terms of an organization’s usage policies."
Political Expedience,"Political Expedience is the practice of making decisions based on political considerations rather than on underlying principles. It is the willingness to sacrifice moral and ethical principles in order to achieve a desired outcome. It is often used by politicians to gain favor with constituents by enacting policies that are not necessarily in the best interests of the public. In other words, it is a way for politicians to appease certain groups in order to gain power or win an election. Political Expedience can lead to short-term gains, but it can also have long-term consequences and often leads to decisions that are not in the public's best interests."
Politically Exposed Person (PEP),"A Politically Exposed Person (PEP) is an individual who has been entrusted with a prominent public function, such as a senior government, judicial or military official; a senior executive of a state-owned corporation; or a senior foreign political figure, such as a family member or close associate. PEPs may present greater money laundering and terrorist financing risks than other customers due to their position and influence, as well as their access to public funds. As such, financial institutions must conduct enhanced due diligence when it comes to transactions with PEPs to ensure that illicit funds and funds associated with prohibited activities are not being laundered through the financial system."
Polyinstantiation,"Polyinstantiation is a security measure used to protect data from unauthorized access. This technique creates multiple copies of the same data stored in different locations with varying levels of access. Each copy contains different versions of the same data and each version is tailored to the user’s level of access. This prevents users from accessing more sensitive data than they should and also prevents malicious actors from extracting all the data in one go. The key to this measure is preventing a single point of access for the data, so that attackers cannot gain access to all of it at once, making it harder to uncover sensitive information. Polyinstantiation makes it harder for attackers to gain access to sensitive data and is an important measure used in Cybersecurity today."
Polymorphism,"Polymorphism is a programming technique in which the same code is used to provide different executions based on parameters or the object used. It allows different code to be executed at different times, which is useful in cyber security. Polymorphism can be used to create software that is more difficult to analyze since the same code will appear differently each time it is executed. It also allows a virus or malware to change its code dynamically, making it more difficult to detect. The use of polymorphism can also be used to hide malicious code inside of legitimate programs to evade detection. Overall, polymorphism is a powerful tool for the development and implementation of secure software."
Ponzi Scheme,"A Ponzi Scheme is an investment fraud that works by paying existing investors with the funds that are collected from new investors. It is named for Charles Ponzi, who ran a scheme in the early 1920s. In a Ponzi scheme, no underlying investment exists, and fraudsters collect money from new investors to pay the earlier investors in a “pyramid-style” structure. Ponzi schemes are often difficult to detect and may collapse suddenly, leaving investors with losses. As an Anti-Money Laundering Expert, it is my duty to identify potential Ponzi schemes and take measures to prevent individuals from becoming victims of such fraud."
Port,"Port scanning is a technique used by cybersecurity experts to analyze the security of a computer system or network by scanning ports to identify which ports are open, filtered, or closed. It is a process by which a computer system or network is probed for open ports, which are ports that are accessible to the outside world. The purpose of a port scan is to identify the open ports, detect the services running on each port, and assess the security of the system by attempting to identify potential vulnerabilities associated with that service. Additionally, port scanning can also be used to detect network intrusion attempts and malicious activities. In summary, port scanning is a necessary tool for any cybersecurity expert to utilize to ensure a system or network is properly secured."
Port Scan,"A port scan is a type of security scan that involves gathering information about the open ports on a network. It is used to identify any weaknesses in a network’s security by finding vulnerable ports that can be used to gain access to a network. Port scans are conducted by a computer program or service searching for open ports on a targeted machine. The program will then send data to the ports to determine what services and protocols the open ports are running, the types of machines running on the network, or to see if a particular port is open. Port scans can be used for malicious purposes, but are also useful for general system administration and for assisting in the detection of security vulnerabilities."
Predicate Crimes,"Predicate crimes are offences that are used to facilitate money laundering activities. These predicate offences can include fraud, drug trafficking, counterfeiting, embezzlement, corruption, tax evasion, and bribery. By engaging in these activities, criminals are able to generate illegitimate funds which they may try to wash through various methods in order to make them appear legitimate. Anti-Money Laundering experts are responsible for identifying, deterring, and monitoring financial transactions associated with these predicate crimes in order to disrupt and prevent the illicit funding of criminal activities."
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP),"Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a type of encryption used for secure communication and digital data protection. It is a cryptographic protocol that uses a combination of conventional data encryption, hashing algorithms, and public-key cryptography to securely encrypt, authenticate, and transmit sensitive and confidential data.

Private banking services include wealth management, portfolio management, trust and estate management, and banking services such as deposit-taking, lending and foreign exchange. Private banking also includes services such as financial and estate planning, tax planning, and philanthropic planning. Private banking is also sometimes called ""private wealth management"" and is a type of financial service that emphasizes preserving and growing the wealth of clients."
Private Investment Company (PIC),"A Private Investment Company (PIC) is a legal entity established for the purpose of carrying out investment activities. These companies are mainly used as vehicles for investments, such as private equity funds, venture capital funds, real estate funds, and hedge funds. They are typically formed for the exclusive benefit of the founders and investors. As such, PICs are not publicly traded and are not required to follow the same rules and regulations as public companies. PICs are subject to Anti-Money Laundering laws and regulations, including Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering Risk Assessment. PICs are generally created to minimize taxes, protect personal assets, and provide a framework to manage and grow investments."
Privileged Access Management,"Privilege Access Management (PAM) is a security discipline that focuses on the proper management of privileged users, privileged accounts, and privileged access within an organization. It ensures that the access privileges of each user are appropriate for their job and that only privileged users are able to access privileged data and resources. PAM is designed to protect users, systems, and data by preventing unauthorized access and monitoring activity. It eliminates hard-coded and shared accounts, controls user access rights, and monitors privileged user activities. PAM also reduces the time needed for account provisioning and de-provisioning. It helps organizations to comply with different regulations and standards, such as PCI-DSS, ISO 27001, SOX, HIPAA, NIST 800-53, and GDPR."
Process Hollowing,"Process hollowing is an advanced technique used by attackers to hide malicious processes from traditional security tools. This technique involves replacing a legitimate process with a malicious one, or hollowing it out, then injecting malicious code into the hollowed process. The malicious code is then configured to run while the legitimate process still appears to function normally. This technique is often used to evade detection by security tools that rely on signature-based detection or rely on monitoring of process names to detect malicious processes. Process hollowing is a highly effective technique that has been used in many real-world attacks, so it is important for cybersecurity experts to be aware of it."
Processing Unauthorized Payroll,"Processing Unauthorized Payroll is a type of fraud perpetrated by malicious actors to trick an organization into releasing payroll funds without authorization. An attacker will manipulate payroll policies and procedures in order to process a payment to a fraudulent bank account, which may be in their own name. The goal is to make off with the money without detection. Organizations can detect this sort of fraud by auditing their payroll policies and procedures, developing effective security controls, monitoring suspicious activity on a regular basis, and reinforcing compliance with established policies. Companies can also improve their fraud prevention by training their personnel to be aware of the indicators of fraud, and working with a specialized third party to conduct due diligence on each payroll transaction."
Program Infector,"A program infector is a type of malware that is designed to spread itself across programs and stored data on an infected system. It typically remains dormant until a particular application is launched, at which point it will infect the program and spread itself to other applications and data. Program infectors are often used to install spyware or to gain access to a computer system via backdoors. It is important to use a reliable antivirus program to detect and remove malicious software before it can cause significant damage."

Prohibited transactions can also involve the sale or transfer of restricted items such as drugs, weapons and explosives. Prohibited transactions must be identified and reported, and if applicable, blocked or stopped in order to prevent the completion of the transaction and to protect the safety and security of individuals, organizations, and even the country."
Promiscuous Mode,"Promiscuous mode is a type of data capture mode available in computer networking. In this mode, the network card is set to accept all packets received from the network regardless of their intended destination. This means that all of the traffic that the network card receives is passed to the CPU for processing, including any broadcasts, multicasts, and any other packets not intended for the computer in question. This differs from the default networking mode, in which only packets addressed to the computer's network card are accepted. Promiscuous mode allows for the entire network to be monitored, but it increases the amount of traffic received, which can have adverse effects on the performance of the computer."
Proofing,"Proofing is a security measure taken to protect online information and transactions. It involves verifying the identity of a user, typically by checking identity documents (e.g. a passport or driver's licence) and using additional analytics and data points to validate they are who they claim to be. It can also include other measures, such as email verification and knowledge-based authentication, where users are asked to answer personal questions. The aim of proofing is to create a secure environment and reduce the risk of online fraud and identity theft by making sure that online users are who they claim to be."
Protocol Stacks (OSI),"A protocol stack, also known as the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model, is a set of communication protocols used to implement the transport of data across various types of networks. This model consists of seven (7) layers which work together to create a reliable end-to-end connection, ensuring that data is delivered in the right format and order. The bottom layer is the physical medium, working up to the application layer which generates data that is sent over the network. Each layer has its own protocol and is responsible for a specific task such as network addressing or routing, ensuring that data is sent securely and quickly. Protocol stacks are used to create a reliable and secure connection, providing the necessary steps to keep data safe from malicious actors."
Proxy Piercing,"Proxy piercing is a method used to attempt to identify and locate a computer, individual, or organization that is attempting to mask its identity or location. It involves the use of techniques such as packet sniffing, IP tracing, and DNS digging. Proxy piercing takes advantage of the fact that even as proxies work to conceal a user's identity, there may still be identifying information contained in a network transmitted packet. This information can include a user's real IP address, Internet service provider information, geolocation, and a user's actual physical location. All of this information can help to identify the user or organization behind the proxy. Additionally, proxy piercing can also be used to determine whether a user is attempting to access a site they are restricted from."
Proxy Server,"A proxy server is a type of server that acts as an intermediary between a computer and the internet, allowing for online requests to be sent from the computer to the internet and vice versa. Proxy servers provide a variety of functionalities, including allowing for the filtering of online requests and data and for the caching of online webpages, thereby reducing internet latency. Proxy servers can also be used for hiding the identity of a computer from the internet, allowing for greater confidentiality when making online requests, and for bypassing certain restrictions, such as country- and region-specific internet content. Ultimately, the use of a proxy server can allow for improved security and privacy while navigating the internet."
Public Key,"Public key cryptography is a form of cryptography which uses two different keys to encrypt and decrypt data. The two keys are known as the public key and the private key. The public key is available to the public and is used to encrypt data. This data can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key. The private key is kept secret and is used to decrypt the data encrypted by the public key. Public key cryptography is an essential part of many secure communication protocols, such as TLS/SSL, SSH, PGP and more. It is also used to create digital signatures and authentication. In addition, it is used to securely exchange session keys, encrypt emails, and authenticate file sharing systems."
Public Key Encryption,"Public Key Encryption (PKE) is an encryption technique that uses two separate keys, one for encryption and the other for decryption. The key used for encryption is known as the public key, and the key used for decryption is known as the private key. In order for secure communication to take place, the public key must be available to all parties, while the private key should be known only to the intended recipient. PKE is a form of asymmetric encryption which allows encrypted messages to be transmitted over insecure channels without fear of interception, as the private key is never transmitted. This provides a secure communication medium and is widely used in the secure transfer of confidential information."
Public-Key Forward Secrecy (PFS),"Public-key forward secrecy (PFS) is an encryption protocol that is designed to secure the data communicated between two entities. It is based on the idea of using a fresh public-key for every session and ensuring that the private key is only available to the server. With PFS, the public keys for past and future sessions can not be calculated from the same shared key. This means that when the shared key is compromised, any past and future communication can't be decrypted, providing maximum protection from potential attacks. This makes it an ideal solution for secure communication channels, especially for applications like banking, e-commerce, and cloud services."
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI),"Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is an essential technology for data security and encryption. PKI is made up of cryptographic components, including digital certificates, ciphers, and digital signatures, that enable the secure exchange of information over insecure networks. PKI requires three main components—a certificate authority (CA), a registration authority (RA), and a repository—that are all necessary for authentication and authorization. The CA is responsible for issuing and verifying digital certificates, the RA is responsible for verifying identities and granting permissions, and the repository is responsible for securely storing and managing certificates. PKI helps to ensure the safety of data and enable secure communication between networks, devices, and applications."
Purchase Amount Filter,"Purchase Amount Filter is a fraud prevention tool that detects potentially suspicious activities by analyzing transaction data. It is used to detect and block transactions beyond a predetermined amount. It works by setting a threshold amount of a transaction and tracking all purchases that exceed this limit. If certain patterns or trends emerge during the investigation, the filter will block further transactions. The filter examines all data related to a purchase such as the amount, currency and location of the buyer, as well as the type of product or service involved. It also investigates the frequency and the pattern of the transactions for suspicious activities. The filter is an effective way of preventing potential fraud by providing fraud investigators with relevant information to analyze."
Pyramid Schemes,"Pyramid schemes are fraudulent investment programs that require participants to contribute money in order to join, with promised monetary rewards for recruiting additional participants. Those who join early on make money off of those that join later, who end up losing money because there's a finite number of participants in the scheme. Pyramid schemes are illegal, since they mainly reward those at the top and lead to many participants losing their money. They are also financially unsustainable since they rely on an ever-increasing pool of new participants. They are additionally damaging to markets by artificially inflating prices and causing market distortions."
Ransomware,"Ransomware is a type of malicious software that is used by cyber criminals, usually to illegally gain access to a computer system or encode and hold important data hostage, in exchange for a ransom. Ransomware attacks typically start when a hacker manages to gain access to a computer network or network device through a malicious email attachment, link, or website. Once in the system, the ransomware will encrypt the victim's data and typically demands payment in return for a unlocking code. To protect against ransomware, it is important to maintain a good backup copy of all sensitive systems and data, as well as ensuring that all the security patches and software updates are up to date, and having an active anti-malware or anti-virus protection. Finally, user education and awareness are essential for spotting and preventing ransomware attacks."

This type of fraud includes activities such as falsifying documents, forging signatures, and selling properties without the knowledge or consent of the rightful owner. It also includes activities such as using false or misleading information to obtain a loan for a real estate purchase, double selling a property, or falsely inflating the value of a property. Real Estate Fraud is a serious crime that can have long-term financial and legal consequences for all involved."
Real Time Gross Settlement Systems (RTGS),"Real Time Gross Settlement Systems (RTGS) is a type of electronic payment system used for the transfer of large monetary funds from one institution to another. This system is used to settle transactions in real-time, meaning that the funds are transferred almost immediately. RTGS also offers high-level security and reliability, as the transactions are immutable and monitored by the central bank, ensuring that transactions are made through trusted channels. As an Anti-Money Laundering Expert, it is important that I understand and remain up-to-date with RTGS to ensure that no suspicious activity is being conducted."
Real-Time Risk Management,"Real-Time Risk Management is an approach to fraud prevention and cyber security that focuses on identifying, monitoring, and responding to digital threats in real time. It employs a combination of user behaviour analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to detect anomalies and potentially malicious activities, which are flagged and responded to quickly. The aim of real-time risk management is to identify fraudulent activities as soon as they take place or when the likelihood of fraud is still relatively low. This in turn reduces the amount of time it takes for an organisation to take corrective measures and limits the impact of any fraud. All in all, real-time risk management solutions offer organisations the power to quickly and effectively respond to cyber threats and fraudulent activities."
Record Destruction,"Record destruction is the process of destroying information or data stored on paper or electronic records. This data could be personal, financial or sensitive in nature. The reasons for destroying records vary; it could be to reduce the risk of fraud or identity theft, prevent the unauthorized access to private information, meet record-keeping requirements or comply with local or federal regulations. The process of record destruction typically involves shredding, burning, or pulping paper records, as well as deleting electronic files or wiping hard drives. To ensure complete destruction, it is important to have the records certified by a trusted third-party. The certification will provide assurance that the records were indeed destroyed and no traces of the data remain."
Record Keeping,"Record keeping is the practice of retaining and organizing documents and other materials related to an organization’s finances, operations, and other activities. It is an important part of any anti-money laundering (AML) program. Record keeping helps organizations understand and comply with AML regulations, which require the collection and analysis of financial records to identify suspicious activity. It also assists organizations in detecting, monitoring, and reporting money laundering activity. Proper record keeping is essential in reducing the risk of money laundering and other financial crimes."
Red Flag,"A Red Flag is a warning sign that may indicate money laundering or other suspicious activity. It is typically used to alert financial institutions and other organizations to activity that may be suspicious or indicative of criminal activity.

SHA1 is considered to be one of the most secure cryptographic hash functions available and is commonly used to create digital fingerprints for software, documents, and other files."
Shadow Password Files,"Shadow password files are an electronic form of authentication created on a computer system to protect user passwords. They are stored in a secret, protected location, separate from the main password file. Shadow passwords allow only system administrators to access user passwords, providing additional security for sensitive user information. When a user attempts to log in to a system, the login program will check both the main password file and the shadow password file for the correct password. This prevents malicious users from gaining access to password files and using stolen passwords. The contents of the shadow files can also be encrypted using a variety of algorithms, making it even more difficult for malicious users to gain access."
Sham Divestment,"Sham divestment occurs when a business or individual attempts to disguise the proceeds of illegal activity by investing in an asset for a short period of time, only to quickly divest the asset and transfer the proceeds out of the country. Sham divestment is a technique used by criminals to commit money laundering. It has become increasingly common as criminals have become more adept at hiding their illicit activities. Sham divestment involves hiding the actual source of the money and can also involve using false names and documents, as well as using companies or trusts to disguise the origin of the funds. To prevent this type of money laundering, financial institutions must be diligent in monitoring and reporting any suspicious activity."
Shelf Company,"A shelf company is a pre-registered company that is available for immediate purchase from a company formation agent. Shelf companies are formed with the purpose of providing a ready-made entity that can be used for various legal and financial purposes. This can include anything from setting up a business, to forming a trust fund or even taking advantage of tax regulations. Anti-money laundering experts must be aware of the formation of shelf companies as they can provide a potential conduit for illicit activities. Transactions may be made through the shelf company to mask the origin of the funds or to launder profits. The expert must remain vigilant in monitoring and investigating any activity by shelf companies."
Shell,"Shellcode is a type of code associated with software exploitation. It is a sequence of bytes typically written in assembly language, which is used as the payload in exploits to gain unauthorized access to a system. It typically consists of instructions that are executed directly in memory without being written to disk, thus bypassing security measures. Shellcode can be used to spawn a new shell, create a new process, or directly inject itself into the memory of a running process. It is often used by attackers to compromise systems, modify processes or escalate privileges on a target machine."
Shell Bank,"A Shell Bank is a financial institution whose primary purpose is to establish the appearance of legitimacy for the purpose of obscuring the identity and source of illicit funds. It does not have a physical presence, is not registered or regulated in any jurisdiction, and does not conduct any banking activities. Shell Banks are often used by money launderers and other financial criminals to conceal or move their assets without detection. The use of Shell Banks also enables criminals to hide the paper trails associated with their activities, making them much more difficult to trace and prosecute."
Shell Company,"A shell company is a corporate entity that has no active business operations, assets or employees and is used to hide the true ownership of a business or investment. These companies are used to evade taxes, move money from one country to another, and launder money. Shell companies may also be used to facilitate fraud and other illegal activities. Since the company has no public records or business activity, it is difficult to trace the origin of assets or investments connected with these companies. In order to combat money laundering, governments have implemented laws requiring companies to accurately identify the beneficial owners of their business or investments."
Shopping Cart,"Shopping cart technology allows customers to purchase goods and services online in a virtual space. It provides customers with a convenient way to collect items they wish to purchase, review their cart and proceed to purchase with ease.

SNMP is most successful when implemented in conjunction with other network management tools, such as, network configuration, access control, and logging."
Single sign-on,"Single Sign-on (SSO) is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications or services with one set of credentials. This includes entering a single username and password to access multiple systems or domains with the same authentication information. SSO is an effective security measure since it reduces the amount of login records, passwords and other authentication credentials that users have to remember and type in. In addition, it enhances security and decreases hacking attempts, since hackers are unable to access multiple systems with a single unsecured set of credentials. Additionally, it streamlines identity management and improves the user experience, reducing the amount of time and effort needed for logging into multiple systems."
Skimmer,"A skimmer is a type of malicious technology used to steal card information from debit or credit cards. It is inserted in point-of-sale machines, ATMs, and other card readers, and it intercepts information from cards as they are used. Skimmers are often hard to detect, as they may fit on top of existing devices and look like legitimate technology. By taking a card's data, skimmers can recreate a card and make fraudulent purchases or withdraw money from the accounts they are connected to. Businesses that accept cards should always inspect their machines and take appropriate security measures to protect against skimmer attacks."
Skimming,"Skimming is a type of fraud in which the perpetrator uses a small, portable device to collect data from unsuspecting victims' credit or debit cards. The device is typically inserted into a card reader and scans the cards' magnetic strips. It then copies the cardholder's information and stores it, allowing the perpetrator to use the data for illegal purposes. Skimming is a relatively common form of card fraud and is difficult to detect as the devices are easy to hide and can come in many forms. To prevent skimming, cardholders should monitor their accounts regularly and look out for any suspicious activity. They should also ensure they use devices with secure locks to ensure their cards' data is safe."
Skimming cash receipts,"Skimming is the illegal practice of falsifying and stealing money off sales receipts. It generally occurs when cashiers and/or store personnel collect payment during a sales transaction, but do not record the payment in the accounting system. The culprits siphon or skim a portion of the total transaction amount by manipulating the sales receipts, or simply pocketing the cash. Other times, they will simply transfer the funds to an alternate, untraceable account. Skimming can be especially damaging to small businesses, jeopardizing their financial stability and reputation. Therefore, it's important for retailers to be aware of potential skimming activities and to act quickly to stop and prevent it."
Small Payment Institution (SPI),"A Small Payment Institution (SPI) is a financial institution that conducts limited payment services on a professional basis, such as handling and transmitting money, issuing and assembling payments, and other related activities directed at providing payment services to the public. These services may include the provision of payment accounts, the execution of payment transactions, the issuance of debit and credit cards, and the sending and receiving of money transfers. SPIs are generally required to register with the relevant local or national regulatory authority and adhere to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements."
Smart Card,"A smart card is a sophisticated type of card, usually with an embedded integrated circuit or microchip, used for authentication, verification, and recording purposes. These cards typically store information, both in the form of an electronic magnetic strip and within the chip itself. The data stored on the card serves as the user’s identity, encryption key and payment information. Smart cards are used primarily by financial institutions and related businesses in order to securely protect customer data and provide secure transactions, as well as increased security against fraud. Additionally, smart cards are often used for government-issued forms of identification, such as drivers licenses, ID cards and passports."
SMishing,"SMishing is a type of malicious attack using SMS (Short Message Service) messages as the delivery vector. This type of attack is most commonly used to trick users into handing over sensitive information like financial details and account numbers. Hackers send fake messages, usually posing as a legitimate company, requesting urgent action such as updating an account or clicking on a link which takes the user to malicious websites or downloads malicious code. A variation of SMishing is called vishing, where the attackers use voice messages instead of text messages. Both SMishing and vishing are utilized as part of a larger range of social engineering attacks as they rely on unsuspecting users giving away sensitive data by responding to malicious messages."
Smurf,"A Smurf Attack is a type of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that is used to flood a network with large numbers of ping requests. It works by sending many ICMP ping requests, with a spoofed source IP address, to the broadcast address of a target network. The resulting flood of ICMP ping replies overwhelms the target network, preventing it from responding to legitimate traffic. The goal of a Smurf attack is to exhaust the target network's resources, making it unable to handle any requests. The attacker does not need to have high levels of technical knowledge to carry out a Smurf attack, due to the easily accessible tools available. It is, therefore, a particularly dangerous form of attack that can rapidly cause serious damage to a network."
Smurfing,"Smurfing is a term used to describe the process of breaking down large amounts of money into smaller transactions, in order to evade detection by anti-money laundering regulations. Smurfing is typically done by multiple people working together, transferring the money through multiple layers of transactions and accounts, making it difficult to trace the original source of the funds. It is important to be aware of this process and monitor transactions to ensure they are legitimate."
Smurfing/Structuring,"Smurfing is an illegal activity that occurs when an individual or group of individuals break up large deposits or withdrawals into smaller amounts, to evade taxes and other strict regulations imposed on larger financial transactions. This activity is also known as ""structuring."" Structuring is the act of intentionally splitting up financial transactions in order to avoid having to report the transaction to the government. Structuring can be conducted by depositing or withdrawing cash in pre-arranged amounts just below the reportable requirements, or through electronic transfers of funds into offshore accounts or accounts with multiple signatories. To avoid detection, criminals may make use of multiple accounts, locations and people to conceal financial activities which violate anti-money laundering and other regulations. The goal of smurfing is to avoid detection by masking large transactions as many smaller transactions."
Sniffer,"A sniffer, also known as a packet sniffer, is a type of software or hardware tool used by cybersecurity experts to monitor and analyze the content of network traffic. It captures data packets and decodes the data to reveal details of the communication such as IP addresses, domain names, and ports. Sniffers can be used to detect malicious or unauthorized network activity, detect network flaws or weaknesses, monitor network performance, and investigate network intrusions. Depending on the capabilities of the tool, it may also have the ability to capture credentials, passwords, and other sensitive data."
Sniffing,"Sniffing is a type of cyber attack that collects data packets being sent or received over a network. Attackers use these data packets to gain access to sensitive data, such as passwords, by decoding, reading, or decoding the content of these packets. Sniffers are software applications which are used to detect and capture this data, which is then used for malicious purposes. It is a common attack that is used to gain access to networks without authorization, since it is not easily detectable. Sniffers can also be used to gain information from the user, such as their IP address, web browsing history, and more. As a result, it is important for businesses to have effective security measures in place in order to protect their networks from sniffers."
Social Engineering,"Social Engineering is the use of tactics and methods to manipulate people into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that can be used to pave the way for a security breach or malicious activity. It is essentially an exploit of human vulnerability by an adversary, and involves gaining access to secure information without using malicious software. It is usually achieved through various methods such as phishing emails, impersonation, malicious websites, telephone scams and other methods of deception, often in combination. Social engineering attacks are becoming increasingly common as the human element in cybersecurity is seen as a viable target for malicious actors."
Social Media Intelligence,"Social Media Intelligence (SMI) is a process which involves collecting data from public sources on the internet, such as social media platforms, web forums, and other sites. This data includes online conversations, videos, images, and user generated content. Data collected is then analyzed to acquire useful information related to risks and threats, including fraud. It can help identify red flags and irregularities, as well as suspicious behaviours and activities. SMI can also provide valuable insights into cyber crime trends, such as malware and phishing attacks. By collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data collected from public sources, organizations can drive effective threat detection and response strategies while keeping their data and customers safe."
Social Media Security,"Social media security is the practice of protecting personal or sensitive data by preventing unauthorized access to or misuse of online information, including accounts, networks and systems. It involves the implementation of protective measures for online systems, applications, and networks to secure the data that is shared and stored on social media sites. These measures include authentication and authorization techniques, encryption, firewalls and other security protocols. Additionally, social media security focuses on the responsible and safe use of social media by creating policies and procedures to guide users in safeguarding their personal information and privacy."
Social media tracking,"Social media tracking refers to the practice of gathering and analyzing data from social media platforms in order to gain insights into people’s behaviors and preferences. This data can be used to anticipate and respond to customer needs, measure the effectiveness of different marketing campaigns, and detect fraudulent activities. Companies use various solutions to track an individual's activities, such as keywords, trends, topics, sentiment, and influencers. They often apply artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze large quantities of data quickly. Social media tracking gives organizations powerful new insights into their users which can help inform decision-making, protect customers, and reduce risk."
Social Security fraud,"Social Security fraud is a type of fraud which involves misuse or abuse of Social Security numbers and benefit payments. Common tactics include creating false identities or using someone else's identity to gain access to government benefits and services. Other forms of Social Security fraud include improperly earning or claiming benefits and receiving benefits from more than one source at the same time. Social Security fraud can also include theft of existing accounts, the creation of fake accounts, and the acquisition of unauthorized copies of Social Security cards. These activities can result in individuals receiving benefits even if they don’t legally qualify, as well as identity theft and personal financial losses."
Social Security Number (SSN),"A social security number (SSN) is an identification code issued by the United States Social Security Administration. It is a nine-digit code used by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax purposes and to track an individual’s earnings, benefits, and eligibility for certain government programs. The SSN is often used as a form of identification for transactions involving finances and as a means of verifying the identity of individuals for various reasons. The SSN is not intended for use in tracking individuals or for use as a credit card number or for any other purpose, and it is considered confidential information. In order to combat money laundering activities, the SSN must be validated before any transaction can be completed involving money or other assets."
Software-As-A-Service (SAAS),"Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a cloud computing model which enables users to access applications and data over the internet. It is a type of application delivery model which allows customers to pay for access to software applications hosted by a provider. In this model, the provider is solely responsible for the maintenance, storage, and operation of the software, which eliminates customer's need for any associated hardware or IT infrastructure. SaaS solutions are scalable and flexible enough to empower businesses of all sizes to save money, improve efficiency and comply with data security and privacy regulations. As a cybersecurity expert, it is important to ensure that SaaS applications are implemented and configured securely, and all customer data is protected."
Software-Defined Networking,"Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an advanced network architecture that uses software to control the flow of data in a network, as opposed to the use of dedicated hardware. It is used to increase flexibility and scalability, as well as improve resource utilization and reduce operational complexity. SDN works by utilizing a centralized controller, which configures and manages the entire network through an ‘open’ software application program interface (API). The controller works together with various software applications to define, manage, and control the network. This enables administrators to efficiently configure, manage, and monitor their networks in real-time by reacting to changes in user behavior and multi-tier traffic. As a result, SDN enables organizations to have better control over their networks and to build advanced services quickly."
Software-Defined Perimeter,"Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP) is a form of cyber security architecture that uses network segmentation to create a secure and virtually impenetrable perimeter around corporate networks and applications. It allows organizations to limit access to their networks to only the users or computers that are explicitly authorized to access them. This permission is granted through a secure method of authentication, authorization, and encryption. SDP enables organizations to better protect their networks from malicious actors and has become an increasingly important part of a company’s overall information security posture. It enables organizations to keep unauthorized users out while allowing authorized users to securely access the resources they need. This helps to keep networks and data secure while reducing risk and ensuring compliance with industry standards."
Software Piracy,"Software Piracy is the illegal copying, distribution, or use of copyrighted computer software without the permission of the software's copyright owner. It refers to the unauthorized duplication and/or use of software such as operating systems, business applications, video games, and entertainment applications. It also includes sharing or installation of software on multiple devices without paying for multiple copies or using a serial or registration in violation of the original software's licensing agreement. Software Piracy has become a huge problem for companies who have invested significant time and money into developing their software and the illegal copying or distribution of their products creates a significant loss of revenue for those companies. In some cases, violations of software piracy can result in criminal and civil liability for offenders."
Software Security,"Software Security is the practice of protecting and preserving the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of computer programs and their associated data. This involves developing a set of security controls that mitigate vulnerabilities in the software, including secure coding and development practices, testing and validation of applications, and access control mechanisms. Software Security also includes measures to protect the hardware, network, and users, as well as other systems that may be vulnerable to attack. By implementing a comprehensive software security strategy, organizations and individuals can better protect their information and systems from malicious attackers."
Spam,"Spam is an unsolicited and unwelcome message sent in bulk by an individual or automated process. Typically these messages are sent to large numbers of recipients who never asked for or consented to receive such communication. The most common example of spam is email, usually consisting of ads for products or services, but other forms of spam such as text messages, Social Media posts and blog comments are increasingly common. Spam is incredibly frustrating and potentially dangerous as it can contain malicious links or software designed to steal data. Some organizations have automated systems to detect and block incoming spam; however, it can still be very challenging to prevent as spammers are constantly finding new methods to get their messages seen."
Spanning Port,"A spanning port attack is a type of malicious attack that takes advantage of spanning port devices such as hubs and switches to gain access to a network. In this type of attack, an attacker sends out a broadcast message that is designed to be seen by every device on the network. This broadcast message allows the attacker to gain access to the devices and possibly the entire network. The attacker will then attempt to gain privileged access to the systems, applications, data, or even other networks. This type of attack can be especially dangerous as the attacker can remain undetected due to the lack of security logging that many spanning port devices have. As such, it is important for organizations to use proper security measures such as firewall and access control to protect the network against such attacks."
Spear Phishing,"Spear phishing is a type of cyber attack that uses email or malicious websites to target specific individuals and gain access to sensitive information. It is usually carried out by attackers who seek to steal data, monetary funds, or intellectual property. They use the personal information of their targets to create messages and websites that look similar to legitimate ones to trick their victims into giving away their confidential data. A spear phishing attack can take the form of a fake email sent from a legitimate source, or a fake website that appears real by copying elements from a legitimate website. The attacker may use personalized information of the target to create a sense of trust and familiarity to make them think the message or website is from a trusted source, leading to the target performing the malicious action required by the attacker. Each attack is uniquely tailored to the victim, making it particularly difficult to protect against."
Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA),"The Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA) is an important piece of Canadian legislation which allows the government to impose economic sanctions on foreign countries, organizations and individuals that pose a threat to Canada's foreign policy and international obligations. The Act allows the government to freeze the assets of those targeted, place restrictions on financial transactions and investments, and impose travel restrictions. The Act also gives the government broad authority to create and implement regulations necessary to give effect to the economic sanctions imposed. The Special Economic Measures Act is a key tool in the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism in Canada."
Special Interest Persons (SIPS),"Special Interest Persons (SIPs) are individuals who are deemed to be of high risk for money laundering. These individuals may come from various backgrounds, including but not limited to politically exposed persons (PEPs), foreign officials, senior business persons, and their family members. These individuals are considered to be more likely to be involved with high-risk activities due to their position, wealth, or power. Anti-money laundering experts need to be aware of these individuals and their activities in order to identify any suspicious transactions or activities."
Specially Designated Nationals And Blocked Persons List (SDN List),"The Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List) is a list of individuals, entities, and organizations maintained by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). It identifies and blocks assets and prohibits transactions with persons who the U.S. government has determined are involved in terrorism, money laundering, organized crime, narcotics trafficking, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other activities. The list includes individuals and entities from around the world and serves as a key tool for anti-money laundering experts in detecting and preventing financial crime."
Split Key,"Split key encryption is a methodology used to achieve encryption. It is a symmetric key encryption technique, where a single key is split into two components and a combination of both the parts is needed to gain access to the encrypted data. In this method, one part of the key is held by the sender (or the user on the sender’s behalf) and the second part is held by the receiver. These key parts can be exchanged electronically or the sender can transport the key securely to the receiver. For a successful encryption and decryption, both key parts are combined by a mathematical algorithm to form a key which can access the encrypted data. This method is extremely secure and reliable, as the whole key is never accessible and both users must possess each part in order to obtain the entire key."
Spoofing,"Spoofing is a cyber attack technique where an attacker impersonates another user or computer system in a network or a communications system. In most cases, spoofing is used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks, or facilities. Spoofing is commonly performed using techniques such as IP spoofing, MAC spoofing, false website authentication, and more. Attackers may also use spoofing to hide their true identity or to launch a denial-of-service attack. Spoofing can be used to disguise malicious activities, and thus make it more difficult to detect and mitigate them. As such, organizations must remain vigilant and employ security solutions that detect and prevent spoofing attempts."
Spoofs,"Spoofing is a type of fraud or cyber attack that usually involves a false or fake identity. It involves impersonating or emulating another person or website in order to gain access to confidential information, or to obtain money or services by deceiving another person. Spoofs can be used to steal passwords or credit card numbers, intercept emails and other digital communication, or to create false identities in order to acquire goods and services. They can also be used to spread malicious software such as viruses, ransomware, and spyware. Spoofing attacks can be difficult to detect and limit, so it is important to internet and network security strategies to monitor and detect them in order to prevent them from becoming more severe."
Spyware,"Spyware is malicious software that is used to secretly collect a user's data without their knowledge or consent. It is often installed without a user's knowledge through software downloads or email attachment and can track a user's activity to gather information or take control of the user’s device. Spyware is difficult to detect as it often runs in the background of the device and can be used to steal passwords, infiltrate networks, and collect sensitive data. It can be used for unethical purposes such as crashing a computer, locking out a user, displaying unwelcome pop-ups, and redirecting web searches. Spyware can also be used to monitor emails and other electronic communications. Sites can be designed to install such malicious software and it is difficult to protect against it. Therefore, it is important to regularly update the anti-virus and firewall software on the computer and to be cautious about download files, even from seemingly reliable sources."
Sql Injection,"SQL Injection is a type of attack on a computer system in which malicious code is inserted into an SQL query through a user interface in order to gain unauthorized access to data held in the database. This attack is often used to steal, modify, or delete sensitive information. The attacker usually uses input fields on a web page or web application to inject code that can be sent to the database. The code is then executed to access the database and extract data from it. This can result in data theft, unauthorized changes, or even deletion of data. Prevention of SQL Injection attacks can be done by carefully sanitizing user inputs before sending them to the database and avoiding dynamic query creation.SQL Injection is one of the most commonly used attacks on web applications and databases, and it is important to understand and protect against this type of attack."
Ssl/Tls,"Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) is a protocol that provides privacy and data security over the internet. It is used to encrypt data sent over internet connections, and also provides authentication of the server, so that users can interact securely with a website. In order for an SSL/TLS connection to be established, a handshake between the client and the server must take place. During the handshake, the server presents its SSL/TLS certificate to the client, which is then verified by the client to ensure it is valid. Once the certificate is deemed valid, the encryption and authentication of data packets occurs and the secure connection is established. Using SSL/TLS provides a high degree of assurance in secure data transmission and should not be overlooked when considering cybersecurity practices."
Stack Mashing,"Stack Mashing is an attack in which a malicious actor attempts to take advantage of the lack of security mechanisms in the memory stack of a computer system in order to execute arbitrary code. It usually involves a combination of exploiting buffer overflows and other memory corruption in order to gain control of the target machine. The attacker is able to inject malicious code into the memory stack, which is then executed by the target system without any security checks. This type of attack can be used to gain access to sensitive information or even gain control of the target machine. It is important that computer systems are regularly tested and patched in order to prevent successful stack mashing attacks."
State Invested Enterprise (SIE),"A State Invested Enterprise (SIE) is an enterprise owned and operated by a governmental entity. It is typically formed to pursue a specific set of goals, such as commercial profit, regional development, or public service. SIEs are commonplace in countries with a strong presence of state-owned enterprises, such as China and India. As entities that can be directly influenced by the state, SIEs pose a unique risk for misuse and money laundering activity. Anti-money laundering experts must be aware of the potential risks posed by SIEs and take the necessary steps to identify, assess, and monitor these entities to prevent and detect money laundering activities."
State Owned Enterprise (SOE),"State Owned Enterprise (SOE) is a business entity owned by a government. The government can be at the federal, state or local level. SOEs can be found in both the public and private sectors, and can either be commercial companies or non-profit organizations. An SOE is a powerful tool for governments to pursue strategic economic objectives. SOEs are typically used to achieve outcomes such as providing essential services, maintaining or creating jobs, or providing a better investment return than private sector competition. As an Anti-Money Laundering Expert, it is important to be aware of the potential abuse of SOEs by criminal organizations and other unethical actors to facilitate money laundering activities."
Statute of Limitations,"The Statute of Limitations is a rule of law that sets out a maximum time period within which legal proceedings must be initiated. This generally applies to civil cases, such as debt and contract disputes, rather than criminal cases. The time period is determined by state law, and typically ranges from one to six years, although some states provide even longer windows. This prevents disputes and grievances from occurring long after the facts of a dispute occurred, and passing beyond the point of which adequate, relevant evidence can be obtained. Therefore, very old matters can be dismissed if it falls outside the Statute of Limitations."
Stealing,"Stealing is the unauthorized taking of a thing of value without the owner's consent. It may involve deception or subtlety and can be done for a variety of reasons. Types of stealing include shoplifting, pickpocketing, identity theft, embezzlement, fraud, and cybercrime. The theft of physical goods and documents are relatively easy to detect, while cybercrimes may be harder to identify or prosecute as they may occur in different parts of the world or on the internet. Stealing can have serious consequences and should be taken seriously, as it can cost businesses, government organisations, and individuals considerable amounts of money and reputation."
Stealing or providing business secrets,"Business secrets, such as a company's trade secrets, formulas, processes, designs or financial data, need to be protected from those who would attempt to gain advantages of the business in an unfair, deceptive or illegal way. Stealing business secrets involves using any means such as hacking, eavesdropping, bribery or infiltration to gain access to such information without the company's permission. This kind of theft often has dire consequences for a business as the perpetrators are often able to gain competitive advantages, as well as financial or marketing benefits. Business secrets are usually protected by law and those found guilty of stealing them can face civil and criminal charges. Companies should have robust measures in place to protect their business secrets."
Stealthing,"Stealthing is a cyber-security attack technique used to hide malicious activities from security systems and monitoring solutions. This attack technique allows attackers to remain undetected by utilizing techniques such as disguise, encryption, and obfuscation. Stealthing involves the use of malicious code to hide a malicious activity from security systems and also evade detection from the user. Stealthing allows attackers to remain anonymous and remain undetected from malicious activities, including the exfiltration of confidential data, injection of malicious payloads, and other malicious activities. In summary, stealthing is a method used to hide malicious activities from security systems and users in order to remain undetected and remain anonymous."
Sting Operation,"A sting operation, also commonly known as an undercover operation, is a type of law enforcement tactic primarily used to catch criminals in the act of committing a crime. Generally, an undercover officer poses as a potential target and initiates contact with the suspect in order to gain information about a criminal activity or to invite the suspect to commit a criminal action. The officer then gathers evidence to prove the criminal’s guilt. The goal of a sting operation is to detect and deter criminal activity, such as money laundering, before any real damage can occur. The undercover officer works to prevent any potential financial losses from the criminal acts from occurring."
STR (Suspicious Transaction Report),"STR stands for Suspicious Transaction Report, which is a report given to law enforcement agencies and financial institutions by financial institutions. These reports are used to identify any potentially illegal or fraudulent activities. They can include activities such as money laundering, identity theft, financial frauds, phishing, online scams and terrorist financing. STRs provide detailed information regarding the customer and their transactions, accounts, statements and details of any evidence that is related to the suspected suspicious activity. STRs are used to help investigate and prevent fraud, money laundering, and other financial crimes. In order to better protect customers and businesses from these financial crimes, STRs are an integral part of the financial services industry."
Straw Man,"A straw man is a form of money laundering in which a third party is used to transfer money from an individual or company to another individual or company. In this process, the third party is used to disguise the true source of the funds and make it more difficult for law enforcement to detect money laundering activities. The third party, also known as the straw man, does not directly benefit from the transaction but is instead used as a middleman to move money between the two parties. The use of a straw man is a popular tactic among criminals to evade the legal regulations and laws governing money laundering activities."
Stream Cipher,A Stream Cipher is a type of symmetric-key cryptography which encrypts data one bit at a time as it passes through an encryption algorithm. It takes a pre-shared key along with an algorithm and encrypts the data bit by bit as it is received. Stream Ciphers are typically faster than block ciphers because they require fewer rounds of encryption and process a single bit of data in each round. They are also more secure because their encryption is state-dependent and the transmitted data can only be decrypted if the key is known. Stream Ciphers are preferred over Block Ciphers in applications where the data must be encrypted in real-time or in situations where the data is transmitted over an insecure network.
Strict Liability,"Strict liability is a legal concept whereby a person or company is held liable for damages or injury regardless of their degree of fault or negligence. It is often used in cases involving environmental pollution, product liability and financial crimes such as money laundering. In money laundering, strict liability applies to certain individuals and institutions, such as banks and other financial institutions, who are responsible for the prevention and detection of money laundering activities. These entities are held liable even if they have not been negligent or knowingly involved in money laundering activities. Strict liability is intended to deter and punish those who are involved in money laundering activities."
String Matching,"String Matching is a technique used to identify and detect suspicious transactions related to money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. This practice involves comparing a sample of known data to a large dataset of searchable records, such as those found in a database or financial ledger. A match occurs when the matching data displays a specific pattern or contains a particular sequence of characters. The goal of string matching is to uncover hidden or unknown relationships and possible financial activity between two entities. When used properly, this technique can be a powerful tool to assist financial institutions in their efforts to detect and prevent money laundering and other financial crimes."
Stripping,"Stripping of Banknotes refers to the practice of removing banknotes from their original packaging for the purpose of disguising their source, concealing illegal activities and avoiding legal requirements such as taxation and reporting. Banknotes can be stripped from their original packaging either manually or through the use of special machinery. In either case, the process of stripping banknotes involves taking the notes from their protective plastic or paper packaging and reorganizing them in a way that obscures their origin and masks any evidence of criminal activity. The process of stripping banknotes is one of the most commonly used techniques for money laundering and other illicit financial activities."
Strong Password,"A strong password is a string of characters used to authenticate and protect access to a system or service. It typically consists of a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols, and numbers, and is at least 8-10 characters in length. A strong password will not contain personally identifiable information (PII) such as birthdates, names, addresses, or phone numbers. Additionally, the same password should not be used across multiple systems or websites. It is important to use a new, strong password for each system or site as a way of securing access and helping to prevent hacking and other forms of cybercrime."
Structuring,"Structuring is an illegal activity used to avoid bank reporting requirements. It involves breaking up transactions into smaller amounts under $10,000 with the intention of disguising the origin, source, or destination of funds. Structuring is a tool used by criminals to launder money and evade taxes. It involves making multiple deposits or withdrawals of small amounts into or from financial institutions. Structuring can also be called smurfing, layering, or fractionalizing. Structuring is a crime and carries heavy penalties, including fines and imprisonment. Anti-money laundering experts work to identify, investigate and report cases of structuring."
Subpoena,"A Subpoena is a legal document issued by a court or governmental entity requiring the recipient to appear in court to provide testimony or produce documents related to a particular case. It is commonly used in Anti-Money Laundering investigations when evidence needs to be gathered from a third-party, such as a bank or a government agency. A Subpoena typically requires the recipient to appear in court on a specified date and provide testimony or documents pertinent to the case. It may also include a demand for the production of financial records or other information relevant to the investigation. Failure to comply with a Subpoena can result in serious legal action, including fines or imprisonment."
Supervised Machine Learning,"Supervised machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the use of algorithms and data to create models that are then used to identify patterns and make predictions. The models are created by analyzing labeled data, where the labels correspond to certain classes or outputs. The model is then trained to recognize input data and generate the correct output. Supervised machine learning is used in many real-world applications such as fraud prevention, risk assessment, cybersecurity, and more. In many cases, the data used as input is highly complex and must be processed in order for the model to accurately infer patterns and generate outputs. This type of AI technology helps automate complex and tedious manual tasks, such as fraud analysis, which allows for a more efficient and accurate way of solving problems."
Suspicious Activity,"A Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) is an official document used by financial institutions and other regulated entities to disclose any suspicious transactions that may be related to money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or other financial crimes. It is a critical component of any Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program as it provides a mechanism for regulated entities to report suspicious activity to the appropriate law enforcement and regulatory authorities. The SAR is a confidential document and may only be shared with relevant authorities or upon obtaining a court order. Failure to file a SAR when warranted may result in severe penalties, including fines and possible criminal charges."
Suspicious Activity Monitoring,"Suspicious Activity Monitoring is a process used by Anti-Money Laundering experts to identify and monitor unusual and suspicious financial transactions. This process involves assessing customer profiles and analysing customer transactions to identify any unusual activity, identifying any red flags and making sure the customer’s identity is verified. Suspicious activity can include large cash transactions, multiple international transfers, or large transfers to or from high-risk countries. Suspicious activity monitoring is used to help identify and prevent any potential money laundering activities, and ensure that financial transactions are compliant with anti-money laundering regulations."
Suspicious Activity Report (SAR),A Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) is a document that must be filed with financial intelligence unit (FIU) to report suspicious transactions that may constitute money-laundering or other financial crime. The SAR must provide sufficient information to identify and explain the suspicious activity and must include the name of the suspect and details of the transaction(s) in question. The filing of a SAR is a legal requirement for financial institutions and other businesses regulated by anti-money laundering legislation. It is a key tool to help combat money laundering and is a critical component of an effective anti-money laundering program.
Suspicious Matters Report (SMR),"A Suspicious Matters Report (SMR) is a report that must be filed with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) when a customer, or a customer’s transaction, raises the suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing. The report is intended to provide information to FINTRAC to assist in its analysis of money laundering and terrorist financing activities, and to identify suspects and associates. An SMR must include detailed information about the customer and their transactions, and must also outline the basis for the suspicion. The reports must be filed promptly following the detection of a suspicious transaction, and must include all important details as required by FINTRAC regulations."
Suspicious Transaction Report (STR),"A Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) is a document that is filed with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) by a financial institution to report any suspicious activities related to money laundering or terrorist financing. An STR provides information about a suspicious transaction that may constitute a possible violation of an anti-money laundering law or regulation. The STR should report the details of the suspected activity, including the identity of the customer, the type of transaction, the value of the transaction and the dates the activity occurred. It is the responsibility of the FIU to review and analyze the STR to determine the need for further investigation."
Sweepstakes Scam,"A Sweepstakes Scam is when a scammer pretends to be offering a chance to win a prize, like money or goods, which is rarely offered. They often require the victim to transfer money or personal information in order to participate in the sweepstakes. These scams are typically distributed via email, telephone, SMS, or social media. Victims are often contacted directly, asking them to “claim their winnings” in some way. The perpetrator will frequently ask for personal information and payment to receive the prize, though the prize is never received. Often times the communication will be threatening or intimidating, making victims feel obligated to follow the instructions. Victims of a sweepstakes scam can be left with empty pockets, compromised identities, and depleted bank accounts. It is important to note that legitimate sweepstakes will never ask for payment or private information."
Sweetheart scam,"A Sweetheart scam is a type of fraud in which the perpetrator establishes a seemingly genuine romantic relationship with the victim in order to gain their trust, then uses that relationship to take financial advantage of the victim. Generally, the scammer will begin by creating a false sense of intimacy then build it up with declarations of love, stories of family tragedies, and requests for help with money. The victim may be asked for money for the scammer's personal use or to help the scammer get out of a perceived financial difficulty. The scammer may even ask the victim to open a bank account for them or to wire money. In the end, the victim is left without love or money and the scammer frequently disappears without a trace."
Swıft Message,"A SWIFT Message is an electronic form of communication used in the banking industry to securely transmit financial transaction messages between financial institutions. A SWIFT Message contains all the necessary information needed to send and receive payments, such as an institution's unique SWIFT ID, the sender and receiver's account numbers, and the amount being transferred. SWIFT Messages are encrypted and include a unique authentication code in order to protect against fraud and ensure the transaction is secure. As an Anti-Money Laundering Expert, it is important to understand the processes behind financial transactions, including how a SWIFT Message works and how it can be used for illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing."
Swindling,"Swindling is a form of fraud that involves deceiving someone through dishonesty. It usually involves a situation where a person is misled into giving away money, property or services by being promised something they are not able to get in return. Common swindling techniques include taking advantage of the victim's ignorance or trust, making false statements, withholding vital information, charging exorbitant prices, promising something and then not delivering, or impersonating a person in authority. Usually, there are no physical signs of swindling, but the effects on the victim can be long-lasting, resulting in serious financial or emotional stress."
Symmetric Key,"Symmetric Key Encryption is a type of cryptographic algorithm that uses the same cryptographic keys to perform both encryption and decryption. It uses a shared secret key to encrypt and decrypt data. The key is generated from a cryptographically secure pseudo random number generator, which is known as the symmetric key. This key must be kept secret for the transmission of data to remain secure. The keys can be 128, 192, or 256 bits long and are used to encrypt and decrypt data within a given session. Symmetric key encryption is faster and more efficient than asymmetric key encryption as only one key is used for encryption and decryption. It is commonly used for encrypting data at rest and for encrypting data in transit."
Syn Flood,"A SYN flood is a type of cyber attack which exhausts a computer's resources by sending a flurry of SYN packets to the target system. SYN packets are the initial packets of the three-way handshake in the TCP/IP protocol. This type of attack works by exploiting the finite resources of the target computer or server. The attack deliberately sends a massive number of SYN packets to the target, which then must respond to each one. The target system becomes overwhelmed with server resources and cannot respond to legitimate requests, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The SYN floods can either originate from a single source or come from multiple distributed sources. These floods can range from small attacks which only last for seconds or minutes to larger, sustained attacks which can last for several hours."
Synthetic identity,"A synthetic identity is a type of fraud involving the creation of a false identity using real and/or fictitious information. A fraudster will combine real information (like a Social Security number and name) with bogus information (like a made up address and other facts) in order to create new fake identities. These identities are then used to open bank accounts, apply for credit cards and obtain various kinds of services. Synthetic identities are harder to detect than other types of fraud because they may not appear suspicious on the surface. In fact, synthetic identities may be used to demonstrate creditworthiness, making them even more difficult to detect. Criminals may use stolen identities or even create their own to exploit financial systems."
Synthetic Identity Creation,"Synthetic identity creation is a form of identity theft perpetrated by a fraudster creating a false profile or persona from existing information from multiple people or entities. Generally, the fraudsters use a combination of real and synthetic data, such as a name, Social Security number and address, to generate the false identity. They then set up false accounts, credit cards, loans and other services in order to commit financial fraud, such as money laundering, tax evasion and identity theft. Synthetic identities can also be used to bypass security measures or disguise certain activities. In addition to financial losses, synthetic identity creation can also damage your reputation and credit score."
Target Match,"Target matching is a method used by anti-money laundering experts to identify and detect suspicious financial activity. It involves the analysis of customer data against established AML risk profiles and parameters. By matching specific customer data to the risk profiles and parameters, the anti-money laundering expert can identify any potential patterns of suspicious activity that could be indicative of money laundering. This method is used to help financial institutions comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML regulations, and to detect and prevent money laundering. It is an essential tool for anti-money laundering experts to help protect businesses and the public from the threat of financial crime."
Targeted Sanctions,"Targeted sanctions are a set of financial restrictions that are designed to limit the activities of specified individuals, entities, or organizations. These sanctions are aimed at individuals, groups, or states that are deemed to be a threat to international peace and security. They can involve asset freezes, travel bans, and arms embargoes. Targeted sanctions are intended to prevent money laundering, the financing of terrorism and other activities that may threaten the safety and security of a country. In addition, they are used to encourage governments to adhere to international standards and human rights as well as to promote economic and political reform."
Tax Evasion,"Tax evasion is the illegal practice of avoiding the payment of taxes by concealing or misrepresenting income or capital gains, or taking improper deductions or exemptions. It is a form of fraud and involves the intentional non-payment of taxes by individuals, businesses, or organizations, as well as a false declaration of tax liabilities. Tax evasion can be committed in various ways, including hiding income from the government, changing the tax code to benefit oneself, or illegally transferring money internationally. By hiding or not declaring income, the taxpayer is able to reduce or eliminate the amount of taxes owed to the government. It is a criminal offense and is punishable by fines, jail time, or both."
Tax Haven,"A Tax Haven is a jurisdiction or country that has low or no taxes with the intention of attracting foreign companies and individuals to store their money and assets. Tax Havens are attractive to those seeking to reduce their overall tax burden, as their low or no taxation structure provides many opportunities for reducing tax liability. Tax Havens often provide secrecy and confidentiality for those seeking to avoid taxation and other legal issues. Tax Havens often have highly beneficial tax laws for foreign investors, allowing them to retain more of their income and assets than in other countries."
Tax Identification Number (TIN),"A Tax Identification Number (TIN) is a nine-digit number issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to individuals and businesses for tax filing and reporting purposes. A TIN is used to accurately identify individuals and businesses to the IRS and help the IRS track taxpayers who are required to pay taxes. Individuals are issued either a Social Security Number (SSN) or an Employer Identification Number (EIN). Businesses are issued an EIN. Without a TIN, the IRS cannot properly identify a taxpayer or process the taxpayer’s income tax return correctly. A TIN is required for many financial transactions and must be used when filing tax returns, applying for bank accounts, obtaining a loan, and other related activities."
Tax Identity Theft,"Tax Identity Theft occurs when someone illegally uses another person's Social Security number or other identifying information to commit fraud or other crimes. It is a crime where someone is trying to gain access to your personal and financial information, your tax refund, or other benefits that you may be entitled to. This type of thief will typically attempt to file a fraudulent tax return with your information, claim a refund, and direct the refund to their own bank account. Your tax records, credit history and even your job may be affected if you become a victim of Tax Identify Theft."
Tcp Fingerprinting,"TCP Fingerprinting is a method of remotely gathering information about a target computer’s operating system, service, and version by inspecting the packet responses from that system. By comparing the pack responses, also known as a “fingerprint”, to a database of known fingerprints, the operating system, service, and version can be identified. This information can then be used to locate a target computer on a network and determine any potential vulnerabilities that the computer may have. Additionally, fingerprinting can provide evidence of a successful attack vector or a potential new vulnerability. By understanding the system and its associated vulnerabilities, it is possible for network administrators to more quickly and easily mitigate a potential security breach."
Tcp Full Open Scan,"TCP Full Open Scan is a scanning technique that helps identify active hosts on a network while avoiding detection by security features or filters. It works by sending a connection request to each port on the target. The scan progresses from a closed port to an open port according to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). This type of scan is used to detect weakly configured services, backdoors, vulnerabilities, and more. The advantage of this scanning technique is that it can be performed quickly and thoroughly. The disadvantage is that it can be detected by security solutions and will cause unnecessary traffic on the network. For this reason, it is important to ensure that the scan is properly configured to ensure minimal disruption."
Tcp Half Open Scan,"The TCP Half Open Scan is a type of network scanning technique used to identify open ports and services running on a machine. In this scan, the attacker sends a SYN packet to the target machine and waits for the response. If the target machine responds with a SYN-ACK packet, it means that the port is open. If the target machine responds with a RST packet, it means that the port is closed. This type of scan is more subtle than a full open port scan, as it does not require the attacker to send a FIN packet to the target. This makes it more difficult for the target machine to detect the scan, as the target machine does not receive a FIN packet."
Tcp/Ip,"TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is the suite of communication protocols used to connect hosts on the internet. It is an industry-standard model used to facilitate communication between two or more computers. It provides end-to-end communication by breaking the data into smaller chunks called packets and then reassembling them at their destination. The packets are then sent through IP, which provides the address of the destination computer. TCP then breaks down the data into more manageable chunks, and then rearranges them into the correct order. This level of communication is essential for secure data transmission, as TCP/IP ensures that data is not corrupted or mishandled throughout the transmission process."
Tcp Wrapper,"TCP Wrapper is a tool used to provide access control to network services. It can be used to limit connections from or to certain IP addresses or networks and to apply access control policies to protect services from malicious activity. The software works by wrapping the TCP port of a service with a modified version of the TCP/IP stack. This modified version acts as a filter that only allows certain packets to pass through and blocks all other packets. The TCP Wrapper can also be used to better monitor the activity of a certain service, such as logging login attempts, failed access attempts and other important information."
Tcpdump,"TCPDump is a powerful command-line packet analyzer tool. It can capture and analyze network data in real time, and can be used for troubleshooting, security analysis, and penetration testing. It supports filtering IP traffic to capture specific frames, can display a variety of network information such as IP addresses, ports, protocol types, and more. By using TCPDump, network administrators can quickly detect and investigate malicious activity on their networks. TCPDump can also be used to monitor the performance of network services, analyze network traffic trends, and troubleshoot network issues."
Tech Support Scams,"Tech Support Scams are an increasingly prevalent form of computer fraud. They involve fake tech support agents impersonating real personnel from reputable organisations in order to deceive people into handing over access to their computers or payment for unnecessary or faulty services. Typically, these scammers will try to acquire access to a vulnerable system by pretending to be from a legitimate tech support organisation, and then use personal information to extract funds from the victim or infect their system with malicious software. The best way to protect yourself from Tech Support Scams is to never give out personal information such as passwords, credit card details or banking information to suspicious callers, and never let anyone access your computer without prior verification."
Technology Theft,"Technology theft is the unauthorized use of technology or technology-related data; often done to gain an economic or competitive advantage. It can vary from taking confidential customer data to stealing intellectual property or company secrets. It can take place online via hacking, online phishing, or other cyber security breaches, as well as offline via physical theft of components or equipment. Technology theft often requires advanced skills and is a complex crime, as criminals purposefully attempt to hide their identity and remain untraceable after committing the theft. Technology theft can also result in serious financial losses and violation of privacy, as well as reputational damage to the victim."
Telecommunication fraud,"Telecommunication fraud is the use of a telephone to commit fraud or theft. This type of fraud can include, but is not limited to, making long-distance calls to phone numbers in foreign countries, using calling cards and phones to receive money in return for goods or services that are never received, or using phone lines or computers to access another person’s account information without their permission. In many cases, the fraud involves taking advantage of unsuspecting or unaware customers, who do not recognize the phone number being dialed or the individual soliciting their credit card information. Other types of telecommunication fraud involve taking advantage of automated systems that record individuals’ personal information for the purpose of committing a crime. Telecommunication fraud is a major issue in today’s digital world, and organizations must implement numerous fraud prevention measures to prevent fraudulent activity from occurring. These measures include encryption(...)"
Telnet,"TELNET is a network protocol used for remote logins between devices over a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network. It allows a user to connect to a network, send data back and forth, and host a variety of services such as file transfers, media streaming, and virtual private networks (VPNs). TELNET is used for telnet logins, which allow a user to access a remote system and run commands. TELNET runs on port 23 and provides an unencrypted, text-based connection to the remote host. It is important to note that TELNET does not encrypt data, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle and eavesdropping attacks. Therefore, it is important to take steps to protect against these types of attacks."
Terrorist Financing (TF),"Terrorist Financing (TF) is the act of providing financial support to individuals or groups involved in terrorism activities. It can take the form of donations, money transfers, and the provision of goods or services. TF can be carried out through legitimate, informal or underground channels. It is often disguised as charitable contributions, and involves the use of front companies and intermediaries who mask the origin of the funds. Terrorist financing is a serious crime and it can threaten the safety, security and stability of many countries. It is vital that Anti-Money Laundering experts remain vigilant and take all necessary measures to detect and prevent TF."
Testimony,"Testimony is a statement given by an individual, which is typically made under oath, in a formal proceeding such as a court trial or legislative hearing. The statement is designed to confirm the truth or accuracy of a fact or situation. Testimony is legally binding and may include both factual evidence and personal opinion. It is important for the witness to be able to clearly articulate what is being stated and provide sufficient supporting information for the court or agency to decide on the accuracy of the testimony."
Third Line Of Defense,"The Third Line of Defense is a critical component of an effective Anti-Money Laundering (AML) framework. It refers to the independent oversight of an organization’s AML program, and it is often referred to as the “first line of defense”. The Third Line of Defense is responsible for such tasks as providing independent oversight, testing and assessing the effectiveness of AML processes, policies, and procedures, and ensuring that adequate controls are in place to detect, prevent and report suspicious activity. The Third Line of Defense also investigates any suspected money laundering activity and evaluates the effectiveness of AML related risk management systems. This form of independent oversight helps to ensure that an organizations AML policies remain effective, keeping financial institutions and customers safe from money laundering."
Third-Party Risk Management,"Third-Party Risk Management is a process of assessing, monitoring, and managing the risks associated with third-party relationships. This includes assessing the risk posed by the third-party service provider, such as a law firm, an accounting firm, or any business partner. The process also includes identifying, evaluating and managing the risks associated with the services that the third-party provides. This includes understanding how the services provided by the third-party could be used to facilitate financial crime or money laundering activities, as well as performing due diligence to ensure that the third-party in question is compliant with applicable laws and regulations. Third-Party Risk Management is an essential element of an Anti-Money Laundering Program and is necessary to ensure that the company's reputation and financial security are not compromised."
Threat,"Threat modeling is a methodology used to identify and assess potential security threats faced by an organization, facilitating the establishment of countermeasures to minimize those risks. It is a process of analyzing the security of a system to identify threats and vulnerabilities. This assessment involves analyzing assets, attack surfaces and threats posed to assets, and assigning risk levels. Threat modeling is an iterative process, with risk levels monitored and adjusted as needed over time as the organization’s risk profile changes. The goal of threat modeling is to measure and understand the risk of potential threats so that appropriate security controls can be implemented to lessen or eliminate the risk."
Threat Assessment,"A threat assessment is a comprehensive process used to identify and address potential threats to an organization, system, or individual. It involves the collection and analysis of data from both internal and external sources to identify vulnerabilities and threats from both physical and cyber sources. The goal of a threat assessment is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the existing threats, their associated risk levels, and the likelihood of those threats being exploited. Through the threat assessment process, organizations can develop a more effective security strategy and appropriate preventive, detective, and corrective measures to mitigate risk."
Threat Hunting,"Threat Hunting is a proactive method of seeking out potential malicious activity and intrusion attempts in an organization's network environment. It entails the use of advanced analytic techniques and tools to search for evidence of malicious activity that may not be visible through conventional security solutions such as firewalls and antivirus software. The goal of threat hunting is to detect, investigate, and respond to malicious activity before any further damage can be done. This is done by leveraging data to uncover emerging threats or malicious activities that have already infiltrated an environment. Threat hunting requires a focused approach, both in the types of threats being sought after and the methods used to do so. By being proactive in the hunt for malicious activity, organizations can more effectively prevent attacks and minimize their damage when attacks do occur."
Threat Intelligence,"Threat intelligence is the practice of collecting and analyzing information about security-related threats to an organization’s assets. This intelligence can come from several sources including open-source intelligence (OSINT), industry reports, security vendors, and internal analysis of logs. Threat intelligence often involves looking for patterns or indicators of compromise (IoC) that could be used to detect malicious activities and malicious actors. It is also used to create preventative measures, such as firewall rules and antivirus signatures, to reduce the risk of similar attacks in the future. By understanding the threats and indicators associated with them, an organization can more effectively close security gaps and reduce its exposure to risk."
Threat Model,"Threat modeling is an active part of security risk management that helps identify, quantify, and prioritize potential threats to an asset, system, or design. It involves analyzing risks, understanding their potential consequences, determining the likelihood of occurrence, and estimating their possible impact. This process involves utilizing specialized tools and techniques to provide a detailed view of the risks and threats to an organization’s assets. It includes identifying malicious actors, researching their methods and motivations, understanding their weapons and objectives, and then providing a framework for mitigating them. Through this process, threat modeling helps organizations ensure the security of their data and systems from both external and internal threats."
Threat Vector,"Threat Vector is a term used in the field of cybersecurity to describe the methods and pathways in which a malicious actor could gain unauthorized access to a system or network. This includes methods of exploiting software vulnerabilities, social engineering, file exploitation, and other malicious tools. These vectors often involve a combination of technical and non-technical attack paths and are used by adversaries to gain access to sensitive data and resources. Potential threats include malware, ransomware, and other malicious activities. Companies and individuals must always be mindful of the risk posed by threat vectors and take steps to mitigate these potential threats."
Threshold Calibration,"Threshold Calibration is a process used by anti-money laundering experts to determine when a transaction is suspicious and requires further investigation. It involves setting a predetermined threshold of activity or patterns of activity that, if met or exceeded, would trigger an alert to be generated, giving the anti-money laundering expert the ability to take further steps to prevent the illicit activity. By using a threshold calibration process, anti-money laundering experts can monitor transactions more effectively, reduce false positives and increase the accuracy of their investigation."
Time To Live,"Time To Live (TTL) is an Internet Protocol (IP) network setting used to prevent data packets from propagating indefinitely. It is used in two ways: to limit the lifespan of data packets and to control the number of hops a packet can travel in order to reach its destination. When a packet is sent, the TTL is set to a certain value by the sender, which is decremented by each router along the way. If the TTL reaches 0, then the packet is discarded and an error message is sent back to the sender. This helps to ensure that no packets are stuck in a routing loop, minimize unnecessary traffic, and avoid congesting the network. TTL is an important security measure as it can help guard against DDoS attacks, malicious sniffing, and other network security vulnerabilities."
Timecard Tampering,"Timecard tampering is a type of payroll fraud that occurs when an employee alters the recorded attendance and hours worked on their electronic timecard or paper timesheet. This type of fraud enables employees to increase the hours they are paid for by submitting more hours worked than they actually completed. Timecard tampering usually consists of a variety of tactics such as changing the start or end time of a shift, submitting multiple time cards for the same hours or entering extra hours for someone else. Other tactics include deleting days or hours worked or even completely creating false entries. This type of fraud can be extremely costly and time consuming to investigate. Employers need to have effective processes and procedures to detect and deter timecard tampering."
Tiny Fragment Attack,"A tiny fragment attack is a type of cyber attack which exploits a vulnerability in the TCP/IP protocol stack, specifically the handling of internet protocol (IP) fragmentation. This type of attack takes advantage of the fact that most systems do not properly validate reassembled IP fragments. Attackers construct malicious IP packets that are split into small fragments which can bypass basic network security measures and exploit security holes on the target system. When these fragmented pieces of data are reassembled on the target computer, they can be used to cause a denial of service attack, data manipulation, or other malicious activities. It is important to ensure that any system’s security measures can properly identify and handle fragments to protect against potential tiny fragment attacks."
Tipping Off,"Tipping off is a term used to describe the act of disclosing to a third party information about a potential or actual Money Laundering situation. It is a criminal offence under many Anti-Money Laundering laws, since it gives criminals the opportunity to hide or transfer their money before the suspicious activity has been reported to the proper authorities. Tipping off is usually done by an insider with access to sensitive information about a customer or transaction. It can be done knowingly, or unknowingly, with the intention of aiding the money launderer. It is important to note that even if the person is unaware of the illegal activity, they could still be accused of tipping off and face criminal charges."
Token-Based Access Control,"Token-based access control is a type of computer security technique used to authenticate user authorisation. It uses token-based authentication systems that provide access to resources after the user has logged into a system. The token is typically a small hardware device or software, which is used to identify the user. The token contains information, such as a user's identity, which is verifiable and can be used to identify the user. Token-based access control typically works by granting users the access to the resources based on their token information, which can be used to authenticate the user. The authentication process requires the user to enter the token information in order to gain access to the resources. Token-based access control is an important security measure for organisations, as it allows for secure and controlled access to resources."
Token-Based Devices,"Token-Based devices are a type of hardware authentication used to securely access networks and resources. This might include two-factor authentication (2FA). These devices are separate physical objects, such as a USB drive or dongle, that are used to authenticate and validate user access. They generate a unique token each time they are used, which is then passed onto the authentication server or resource to grant or deny access. This ensures that the user is authorized and that their identity is verified. Token-based authentication is widely used in many industries, such as government, healthcare, and finance, to protect confidential data and resources."
Tokenization,"Tokenization is a security process in which sensitive data, such as payment card numbers, is replaced with a series of random numbers and letters (called a token) for storage and transmission. Tokenization adds an additional layer of security to the process, as the token cannot be used as a form of payment, unlike a payment card number. Tokenization is used to protect confidential and sensitive information, preventing unauthorized users from accessing the original data. Tokenization is used in a variety of different fields, such as healthcare, retail, and banking. In the financial industry, tokenization is used to protect payment card numbers, protecting against fraud and preventing the data from being stolen. Tokenization is an essential security measure and helps to ensure the safety and security of sensitive information."
Toll Gates,"Toll gates are measures that can be used by Anti-Money LaunderingExperts to identify and prevent money laundering by monitoring and analyzing the movements of funds from one point to another. Toll gates are typically placed at various points within a financial system, such as on a bank’s internal communication networks and external connections. Once funds pass through a toll gate, they will be subject to automated filters, checks, and other monitoring processes in order to detect any suspicious activity. By identifying and halting suspicious transfers, the toll gate system can help to prevent criminals from successfully laundering money."
Topology,"Topology is the layout of the network and the route paths between any two interconnecting devices within a network. It can be used to describe how the devices within a network are arranged and how they communicate with one another. Topology is a critical factor in the operation of a secure network as it helps to establish rules for communication paths and device placement. Topology can be of various types such as Bus, Ring, Star, Mesh and Hybrid Topologies. Each topology has its own advantages and disadvantages and thus selecting the right type of topology is important to ensure the efficient, secure and reliable operation of the network. Additionally, the topology should be monitored and updated as per the changes in the organization's environment to ensure that the network remains secure from malicious threats."
TOR,"TOR (The Onion Router) is an open source software project created to increase online privacy by enabling internet users to remain anonymous. It routes internet traffic through a network of servers in different countries, making it difficult for anyone to trace or monitor online activities. TOR works by encrypting data and sending it through several layers of security-enhanced proxy servers. This divides the communication into multiple parts, known as “onions”, and passes the data through this network of servers, making it harder for any attackers or surveillance agencies to spy on users activities online. Generally, it is preferred over other virtual private networks (VPNs) as it provide much better privacy and also shows better anonymity since it prevents any third-party from accessing or keeping IP logs of its users."
Trade-Based Money Laundering,"Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML) is a method of laundering criminal proceeds by disguising the illegal source through the use of trade transactions. It typically involves the use of false invoicing, under or over-invoicing of goods or services, mislabeling of goods or services, and/or the use of multiple shell companies. TBML can also involve the use of fraudulent documents, such as commercial invoices, customs declarations, bills of lading and letters of credit. This type of money laundering can occur in any sector that involves international trade, including goods, services, commodities, and virtual currencies. As an Anti-Money Laundering Expert, it is important to be aware of TBML as it is a major source of money laundering and terrorist financing."
Trade Based Money Laundering (TBML),"Trade Based Money Laundering (TBML) is a complex system of financial transactions used to hide the true origin and ownership of criminal proceeds. This often involves disguising the illegal funds as legitimate transactions in the international trade system. Criminals abuse international trade networks, mispricing invoices, under-invoicing, over-invoicing, or using trade based services such as shell companies, trusts, or holding companies to hide the true source of the funds. TBML can be used to launder the proceeds of a wide range of criminal activities including drug trafficking, terrorism, arms dealing, and bribery. As an Anti-Money Laundering Expert, it is your job to help governments, financial institutions, and law enforcement identify and combat TBML."
Transaction Authentication Number (TAN),"A Transaction Authentication Number (TAN) is a one-time code which is used in online banking and other financial transactions to verify the authenticity of the transaction. It is generated randomly and usually sent to the user via email, text message, or physical documents such as paper letters. The TAN provides an additional layer of security to protect the account from unauthorised access and fraudulent activity. The TAN is typically short-lived and must be used for a single transaction to validate the authenticity of the transaction request. It is also important to remember that a TAN should never be shared or stored electronically, as failure to adhere to these security measures can result in a breach. Through the use of TANs, financial organizations can significantly reduce their risk of becoming victims of fraud and cyber threats."
Transaction Monitoring,"Transaction Monitoring is an anti-money laundering (AML) technique used to detect, investigate, and report suspicious financial transactions. It involves systematically monitoring transactions for irregularities that may indicate money laundering or other financial crimes. Transaction Monitoring includes identifying suspicious transactions, analyzing them for indications of money laundering, and reporting suspicious activities to the relevant authorities. It is an essential component of an effective AML program as it helps to identify suspicious activities before they can be used to commit financial crimes."
Transaction Monitoring And Filtering Programs (TMPS),"Transaction Monitoring and Filtering Programs (TMPs) are computer software programs designed to detect, monitor and report suspicious financial activity. TMPs utilize sophisticated algorithms and data gathering techniques to detect anomalies and provide alerts to potential money laundering or other fraudulent activity. TMPs are used to analyze and report activities such as large dollar transactions, multiple transactions with the same customer, or transactions to/from high-risk countries. TMPs can also provide additional data for analysis such as customer demographics, transaction patterns and trends. The purpose of TMPs is to reduce the risk of money laundering by providing more real-time data and insights into customer behavior."
Transaction Screening (TS),"Transaction Screening (TS) is the process of utilizing automated systems and/or manual reviews to identify potentially suspicious financial transactions. TS looks at a variety of factors such as the source of funds, the purpose of the transaction, and the parties involved in order to determine the risk of money laundering. TS can also include checks on customer information, such as whether a customer is on a watch list, or has been flagged for terrorism financing. By evaluating these factors, TS helps to identify suspicious activities and protect financial institutions from criminal activity and reputational damage."
Transliteration,"Transliteration is a process of changing the written form of a language from one alphabet to another. It is an important tool for Anti-Money Laundering Experts as it allows them to detect and identify potential money laundering activities by comparing the same name in different languages or written forms. Transliteration also allows for comparison across databases, as names may appear differently across different records, yet still refer to the same person. This can help to uncover potential money laundering and other suspicious activities, while also making it easier to identify the parties associated with these activities."
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP),"Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a communication protocol which operates at the transport layer of the TCP/IP protocol suite. It is a connection-oriented protocol which provides reliable transmission of data from one node to another. It uses 3-way handshaking to establish and terminate the connection between two nodes. It does this by using cumulative acknowledgments and flow control using sliding window protocol. It also provides error checking and recovery for the data being transmitted by resending the data if required. It ensures that the data is transmitted in the same order as it was sent and also checks for duplicate data being sent over the network. In summary, TCP provides secure, reliable and error-free transmission of data over the internet."
Transparency International (TI),"Transparency International (TI) is an international organization that works to combat corruption and promote transparency, accountability, and integrity in government and business worldwide. TI is a global network of civil society organizations that are committed to fighting corruption at all levels and advocating for laws, policies, and practices that make governments and businesses accountable to their citizens and customers. TI works to ensure that public resources are used efficiently and wisely and that private resources are not misused or diverted to illicit activities. TI assesses countries’ progress and identifies areas for improvement in order to strengthen their anti-corruption efforts. Additionally, TI provides technical assistance, capacity building, and research services to governments, businesses, and civil society organizations to support them in their anti-corruption and anti-money laundering efforts."
Transport Layer Security (TLS),"Transport Layer Security (TLS) is an industry-standard protocol for securing online communication and transactions. TLS helps create a secure environment between two or more applications, devices, or networks by establishing a secure “tunnel” that ensures data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity. TLS is based on the concept of public key cryptography - whereby each end of the secure channel holds a cryptographic key to authenticate their identity and encrypt/decrypt the data they communicate. Additionally, TLS supports additional features such as forward secrecy, which generates a new key for each session, and perfect forward secrecy, which prevents the eavesdropper from decrypting any communication even if they manage to capture data from a previous session."
Transshipment,"Transshipment risk is a type of money laundering risk that arises when money is being moved from one jurisdiction to another. It is a risk in which money is moved from one country to another, often without the knowledge of the government in the receiving country. Transshipment risk is particularly high in countries with weak banking systems, inadequate regulation of financial institutions, and unreliable or nonexistent recordkeeping. The risk arises because it is difficult to track the movement of funds between countries, making it difficult to detect any suspicious or criminal activity. As such, it is important for anti-money laundering experts to be aware of transshipment risk and to analyze and monitor the flow of funds between jurisdictions to ensure that suspicious or criminal activity is not taking place."
Triangulation Fraud,"Triangulation fraud is method of fraud whereby a malicious actor attempts to exploit multiple companies or individuals in order to gain illegal financial gain. The scam works by luring two or more parties into entering into a transaction involving payments, goods, services or transactions. The scammer then utilises the transaction for their own ill-gotten financial gain. Typically, the scammers will request one party to pay into their own account, divert payments, or request goods upfront without intending to pay later. Furthermore, the scammer may act as an intermediary in a transaction, helping to broker deals and then attempt to take the profit without providing the agreed service or goods. This type of fraud is very difficult to spot, as all parties involved could be acting in good faith, unaware of the scam until it is too late."
Triple Des,"Triple DES (also known as 3DES, Triple Data Encryption Standard, and 3-DES) is a type of symmetric encryption technology used to securely protect data. It is based on the DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm which encodes data three times using three different keys. Triple DES breaks up each encryption into 3 separate encryption algorithms, allowing for longer encryption lengths and improved security. Triple DES encrypts data by taking a 64-bit input, breaking it up into two 32-bit halves, encrypting the halves separately, and then combining them. The encryption process happens in the same way each time, but with different keys. By using different keys, the output is a different result, making the encryption algorithm much harder to crack. Triple DES is used for a wide variety of applications, such as securing online transactions and securing military, government, and enterprise networks."
Trojan,"A Trojan or trojan horse is malicious type of software that is made to look like a legitimate file, program or application. It is designed to appear harmless, whilst secretly performing unwanted functions, such as downloads, installation of malware, data theft and other malicious activities. Trojans are usually downloaded unknowingly along with legitimate software and can be spread through malicious websites, deceptive email attachments and other malicious activities. Trojans can be used to gain access to user account credentials, banking details, personal data, and more. By gaining access to these details, criminals can steal money and commit identity theft. Once inside a system, a Trojan can exploit vulnerable spots, spread malware further and disrupt computers, networks and servers. It is essential for people to be aware of the dangers of Trojans and to take preventative measures such as not opening attachments from unknown sources and using anti-virus software."
Trojan Horse,"A Trojan Horse is a type of malicious software (malware) that appears to be legitimate but performs a hidden malicious activity without the user's knowledge. It is named after the mythological Trojan horse used by the Greeks to invade the city of Troy. Trojan Horses are designed to gain access to a user's system and spread malicious code, steal data, or send malicious commands in the background. They can be used to gain access to a user's personal information, financial information, and system resources. Additionally, they can be used to manipulate user accounts and disable system security features, allowing hackers to further exploit the compromised system. It is important to note that many Trojan horses are difficult to detect and contain, even with the most advanced security measures."
True Negative,"True Negative occurs when a security system successfully identifies lack of malicious activity or threat. It is a measure of the effectiveness of a security system, typically calculated for anti-malware and fraud prevention systems. A true negative result means that a system detected the absence of threat and no related malicious activity was detected; in other words, a security system correctly identified the lack of risk. True Negative provides an accurate measurement of the system performance, meaning that the system identified malicious activities, but also false alarms. As such, an ideal security system should provide an acceptable rate of both true positives and true negatives in order to ensure that threats are detected and that system performance is not compromised."
True Positive,"True Positive occurs when a fraud detection method correctly identifies that an anomaly or unusual behavior is fraudulent. True positives are important because a correct identification helps stop fraudulent activity and preserves the security of a customer's account. True positives allow organizations to avoid false positives, which can result in a customer's access being wrongly restricted or blocked. True positives come in the form of early warning signs and help identify irregularities in customer activity or digital systems. Organizations must manage false negatives and false positives to ensure that their systems are accurately detecting fraud and other suspicious activities. True positives should be carefully and consistently monitored so that the organization can be proactive in detecting and preventing fraud."
Trust,"A trust account is a special account at a financial institution that is used to hold assets for a third party. This account is typically used in situations such as estate planning, when a guardian is appointed for a minor, or when a lawyer is holding funds for a client. The assets in a trust account are owned by the beneficiary and are managed by a trustee who is responsible for investing and managing the funds in a way that is in the best interests of the beneficiary. As an Anti-Money Laundering Expert, it is important to be aware of the trust accounts held by clients and look out for any suspicious activity associated with these accounts."
Trust Or Company Service Provider (TCSP),"A Trust or Company Service Provider (TCSP) is an entity or individual that provides services related to the formation and management of legal entities and trusts, including: acting as a director, secretary, or shareholder of a company; providing a registered office, business address or accommodation address; assisting in the formation of legal entities; and/or providing a nominee director, nominee shareholder, or trustee. TCSPs must be authorised and regulated by the appropriate financial authorities and are subject to Anti-Money Laundering regulations. In doing business, TCSPs are required to identify their clients, monitor the purpose and activity of the account or relationship, report any suspicious activity, and ensure that any funds received are from a legitimate source."
Trustee,"A Trustee is a person who holds legal title to assets for the benefit of a third-party, known as a Beneficiary. The Trustee is responsible for managing and preserving the assets in accordance with the terms of the trust agreement, applicable law, and any specific instructions from the Beneficiary. This includes investing and distributing the assets as well as protecting them from harm. Anti-Money Laundering experts play an important role in the Trustee network, ensuring that all Trustee activities are conducted in accordance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, thereby protecting the Beneficiary's assets from being used for illicit activities."
Tunnel,"Tunneling is a networking technology used to create a secure connection over an unsecured network, such as the Internet. It allows data to be transmitted in a secure, encrypted form over the Internet, protecting it from outsiders. Tunneling works by encapsulating data within another protocol, such as IP, to add additional layers of security. This encapsulated data is then sent over the public network, making it virtually impossible for a third party to access the data, as it is being transmitted securely. Tunneling is a key component of secure internet communication, as it prevents the interception and alteration of data during transmission."
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA),"Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a security system that requires two separate forms of identification in order to verify a user’s identity. The two factors could be a combination of something the user knows (a password or PIN) and something the user possesses (a hardware token or mobile phone). The benefit of 2FA is that it provides an extra layer of security for users by making it more difficult for attackers to gain access to sensitive data. The two forms of identification must match for the user to be validated and allowed access. For example, an online banking service may use 2FA to verify a user’s identity when they log in. First, the user will enter their username and password, and then they will be asked to supply the correct PIN or answer a security question. Without supplying both pieces of information, the user will not be granted access."
Two-Step Authentification,"Two-step authentication (also known as two-factor authentication or multi-factor authentication) is an authentication process that requires two separate steps or components for a user to gain access to a system. The system requires the user to provide two different types of evidence that they are authorized to use the system. This can include providing a combination of a username and password, as well as a physical token or biometric data, including a finger print, voice or face recognition. The two-step authentication process provides added security by ensuring that a hacker attempting to gain access to a system must have both pieces of information in order to do so. This added security layer helps to protect critical systems and data from malicious activities and unauthorized access."
Two-Step Verification,"Two-Step Verification is a process in which a person or organization must authenticate themselves using two distinct methods. The first step requires the user to enter a username and password, which is then verified against a database. The second step requires a verification code sent to the user's device. This code is then entered into the verification prompt in order to finish the authentication process and grant access to the account. Two-Step Verification is an additional layer of security used to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to an account or system. It adds an extra layer of security to protect private and confidential information."
Typologies,"A typology is an analytical method used by Anti-Money Laundering experts to categorize money laundering activity into distinct categories. These categories are identified by common methods, processes, and activities used to facilitate money laundering. The typology can help to identify the source of illicit funds, the methods used to transfer funds, and the type of goods and services used to launder money. By understanding the typology of money laundering activity, experts can build a better understanding of the methods and processes used to move illicit funds and take more effective steps to combat it."
Typology,"Typology is the study of different types of money laundering techniques, which can be used to identify patterns in activities that are suspected to be related to money laundering. It is a process of categorizing different types of money laundering activities and identifying the similarities and common trends between them in order to better understand money laundering as a whole. Different typologies of money laundering can be used to identify common methods and practices used, which can help in the prevention and detection of money laundering activities. Typology also helps to identify characteristics which are common amongst particular money laundering activities, which can assist with the analysis and investigation of money laundering."
U.Streasury,"The U.S. Treasury is the federal government agency responsible for managing the national debt, issuing currency, and managing the government’s financial resources. It has also become a major player in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing by implementing the rules and regulations of the Bank Secrecy Act. The Treasury enforces these regulations through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which has the authority to issue subpoenas, examine bank records, and take civil and criminal enforcement action against violators. It also works with several other U.S. government agencies, as well as international organizations, to combat financial crime."
U-Turn Payment,"U-Turn Payment is a type of international payment transaction that occurs when funds sent from the United States to a foreign country are sent back to the United States without the involvement of the original sender or recipient. This type of transaction is sometimes used by criminals to conceal the true ownership of funds, and is therefore a red flag for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) experts. U-Turn payments may also be used to avoid foreign currency exchange controls and capital flight restrictions, as well as to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing and other illegal activities. For this reason, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) experts must evaluate U-Turn payments carefully to ensure that they are not potentially related to criminal activities."
U2F (Universal 2 Factor),"U2F (Universal 2 Factor) is a security technology for authentication. It provides a secure two-factor authentication that is fast and easy to use. It is an open authentication standard that uses secure public key cryptography. U2F attempts to combine elements of authentication, risk assessment, and cryptography to secure user access. It typically uses a physical device such as a security key or a key fob in order to generate a one-time use code that must be entered in order for access to be granted. This token code is unique for each user and is easily identifiable, adding an extra layer of security to the user's account. This helps protect against fraud and identity theft, as the code cannot be guessed or easily damaged. U2F is rapidly becoming a preferred choice for cyber security because of its dual layer of protection."
Udp Scan,"UDP scanning is a cybersecurity technique used to identify open ports on a target system. During the process, a user sends UDP packets with no content (null UDP packets) to ports on the target, and records the responses. The response received from the port indicates whether it is open, closed, or filtered (blocked). This technique is used by security experts to assess the vulnerability of a system and identify possible malicious activities such as DDoS attacks (distributed denial-of-service). Implementing UDP scanning is an important security measure for any organization, as it can help to identify open ports that could be leveraged by attackers."
Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO),"The Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) is the natural person(s) who ultimately owns or controls a legal entity, and/or the person on whose behalf a transaction is being conducted. UBOs can be the direct or indirect owners of a company, any members of the board or senior management, or any persons exercising ultimate control over the legal entity. UBOs must be identified and verified according to standards set by Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. The identification of UBOs is important to ensure that beneficial owners of legal entities are not anonymous and to prevent legal entities from being used for money laundering."
Un Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001),"UN Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001) is a United Nations Resolution that addresses the threat of terrorism. It requires states to prevent the financing of terrorist acts, freeze assets that are related to terrorist organizations, criminalize terrorist activities, and cooperate with other states in such activities. The Resolution also requires states to criminalize the concealment or conversion of proceeds from criminal activity, as well as the concealment or conversion of property from its lawful owner. The Resolution further establishes a Committee of the Security Council to monitor the implementation of its provisions and to assist states in meeting the requirements of the Resolution."
Unauthorized Disbursements,"Unauthorized disbursements are financial transactions that are conducted without the authorization of the rightful owner. This fraudulent activity can occur through various scams including the use of stolen credit cards, unauthorized ACH transactions, fake checks, or other fraudulent methods. Having proper fraud prevention measures in place to monitor and protect against these activities is essential in order to limit the damage caused by this type of theft. To protect against unauthorized disbursements, organizations should have multiple levels of safeguards such as implementing processes to detect and review suspicious activities, providing user authentication for validating users' identity, and having systems in place that can detect and alert whenever a fraudulent transaction occurs."
Unauthorized use of assets,"Unauthorized use of assets refers to the use or misuse of physical or digital resources without official permission. This could include stealing, hacking, or taking control of company resources or information in order to gain some advantage or commit fraud. Unauthorized access might also involve the use of passwords, access tokens or other confidential information, as well as manipulating operating systems, or networks to commit a crime or gain access to a system or data. It is considered to be a serious crime, with severe penalties for offenders. Cyber security professionals use specialized tools to detect, prevent and mitigate such unauthorized activities."
Unauthorized Withdrawals,"Unauthorized Withdrawals refer to money that is taken from an account without the account holder’s permission. This type of financial fraud is commonly referred to as “theft” or “theft by deception”, as the perpetrator usually takes advantage of vulnerable clients who have either signed up for new accounts or granted access to existing accounts. Unauthorized withdrawals can take many forms, such as taking out a loan or opening a new credit card and then quickly closing it to a making unauthorized transfers or withdrawals from an automated teller machine or account. Banking institutions and other financial services are constantly looking into ways to better protect clients from this type of fraud."
Underground Banking,"Underground Banking is a term that refers to an alternative system of finance that operates outside the traditional banking system. This type of banking involves the use of private networks, informal money transfer systems, and unregulated financial transactions. It is often used to transfer large amounts of money without leaving a traceable paper trail, making it a popular choice for people looking to launder money or evade taxes. These underground networks are often used by organized crime groups and terrorist organizations to hide or move illicit funds and also by individuals or businesses who are seeking to avoid financial regulations or taxation."
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI),"A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters used to identify a resource in the World Wide Web (WWW). It specifies a method for identifying and locating a resource such as a website, a directory on a server, or a specific file. An example of a URI is http://www.example.com/index.php. A URI consists of three major components: the scheme, the authority, and the path. The scheme describes the protocol used to access the resource, the authority typically indicates the hostname of the server, and the path specifies the hierarchical structure of the directory. URI also serves to provide an effective way to secure and identify web resources in a secure manner."
Uniform Resource Locator (URL),"A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a way to denote a specific web page or resource on the internet. It is used to identify and locate a particular resource on the internet, such as a website, web page, file, or other resource. URLs consist of multiple components, such as protocol, server name, port number, and file name. URLs allow users to access and view web content by typing in the address or clicking on a link from another web page. URLs are used by web browsers to find and display web pages, and also to reference resources embedded within a web page. URLs also play an important role in Cybersecurity by providing a way to verify the authenticity of websites and helping to protect users from malicious activities by providing a way to identify potentially dangerous URLs."
Unilateral Sanctions,"Unilateral sanctions refer to one state or organization introducing economic and other restrictions against another state or organization. These sanctions may include the freezing of assets, trade embargoes, the banning of imports or exports, or the restriction of travel to and from the sanctioned state or organization. The purpose of unilateral sanctions is to put international pressure on specific countries in order to compel them to act in a way that is acceptable to the rest of the international community. Such sanctions are used to discourage activities such as human rights violations, weapons proliferation, terrorism, and money laundering."
Unique Identity,"Unique Identity is a term used to describe a system or set of authentication credentials that provides a form of verification based on dedicated and reliable data sources. It is used to validate an individual’s identity, providing an extra layer of security during online activities such as online banking or online purchases. Unique Identity can be an individual’s biometric data, a passport number, government-issued ID, driving license or social security number. Other forms of Unique Identity include individual’s behavior or lifestyle, device ID’s, two-factor authentication, dynamic security questions and third-party authentication services like Equifax ID or Experian ID. Unique Identity plays a vital role in fraud prevention and cyber security measures, as it helps to ensure that the user is a real person, preventing identity theft and other types of financial or identity fraud."
United Nations Act (UNA),"The United Nations Act (UNA) is an international law that requires all states to take measures to prevent and combat money laundering and other related criminal activities. The UNA specifically requires states to ensure that their financial institutions and systems are not used for money laundering, by implementing laws and regulations that mandate reporting of suspicious activities and transactions to the relevant authorities. It also obliges states to cooperate with one another in investigations and prosecutions of money laundering and other related criminal activities. The UNA provides a framework for international cooperation and information sharing and facilitates the enforcement of laws and regulations to combat money laundering."
United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC),"The United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) is an international agreement to combat global corruption. It was adopted in October 2003 and entered into force in December 2005. It is the first legally binding global anti-corruption instrument and is a comprehensive, legally binding agreement which promotes preventive strategies and enhanced international cooperation to fight corruption. It includes provisions to deter, prevent, and detect corruption and to improve international law enforcement and asset recovery. The Convention requires States to criminalize a range of activities, including bribery, trading in influence, money laundering, and abuse of public office. It also sets out measures to prevent, detect, and punish foreign bribery and provides for the return and exchange of stolen assets."
United Nations Security Council (Sanctions) (UNSC),"The UN Security Council (Sanctions) are measures taken by the United Nations Security Council in order to maintain international peace and security, as provided in the UN Charter. These sanctions usually involve the freezing of assets, prevention of international trade, as well as other measures issued by the Council. As an Anti-Money Laundering Expert, it is important to be aware of the measures imposed by the UNSC, and ensure financial institutions comply with the standards set out by the Security Council in regards to the freezing of assets and other applicable measures. UNSC sanctions are an important tool in the fight against money laundering and terrorism financing."
United Nations (UN),"The United Nations (UN) is an international organization founded in 1945 to promote world peace, security, and socio-economic development. It is made up of 193 member states and five permanent members on the Security Council. The UN is responsible for maintaining international peace and security, protecting human rights, providing humanitarian assistance, promoting sustainable development, and upholding international law. Its most prominent organs include the General Assembly, Security Council, Economic and Social Council, and Secretariat. The UN works to achieve its goals through diplomatic negotiations, peacekeeping operations, and collective security arrangements."
Unsupervised Machine Learning,"Unsupervised machine learning is a method of artificial intelligence that uses data sets to identify patterns and structures in data without giving the program a predetermined output directive. It relies on clustering and association algorithms to identify patterns that the program may not have been programmed to look for. It is useful for detecting anomalies and fraud that the programmer may not have specifically identified. Unsupervised machine learning offers flexibility, as it can be used to detect trends and patterns that the actual programmer cannot identify. Additionally, it can help improve the accuracy of predictive models, because it can identify correlations that the programmer is not aware of."
Unusual Transaction,"An unusual transaction is a financial activity that may indicate money laundering, terrorist financing or other financial crime. Generally, an unusual transaction is one that is not consistent with the customer's or business's typical activities and is inconsistent with the financial institution's normal risk profile for that customer or business. An unusual transaction may be one that does not have an apparent economic purpose or one where there is an unusual or suspicious pattern to the activity. Red flags for unusual transactions include discrepancies between deposits and withdrawals, irregular or unusually large transaction amounts, transfers from or to high risk or sanctioned countries and multiple payments from the same customer."
URL spoofing,"URL spoofing is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker creates a convincing but fraudulent website that is designed to mimic a legitimate one. The attacker does this by manipulating the Domain Name System (DNS) to make it appear as though the fraudulent site is the legitimate one. By tricking a user into accessing the fraudulent URL, the attacker can gain access to sensitive data and potentially even buy goods or services from an unsuspecting customer. The attacker can also use the spoofed site to deliver malware, phishing attacks, and other malicious content. URL spoofing is particularly dangerous as it can be deployed without the user's knowledge or suspicion. To mitigate the risk of URL spoofing, it is important to ensure your web browsers have up-to-date security software, carefully read website URLs, and consider using SSL/TLS encryption for sensitive transactions."
Usa Patrıot Act,"The USA PATRIOT Act (Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001) is a federal law that was signed into effect in October 2001 to strengthen national security. It enhances the United States government’s ability to detect, investigate and prosecute terrorism, money laundering, and other financial crimes. The legislation requires banks, securities firms, and money services businesses to establish customer identification and verification programs; report suspicious activity; and maintain records for certain transactions. It also enables the government to access financial records with minimal judicial oversight. The Act is an important tool in the fight against money laundering, which can be used to fund terrorists and other criminals."
User Datagram Protocol (UDP),"The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol which operates on the Internet Protocol (IP) and is used for the efficient transfer of data between end points. It is an alternative to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). UDP is suitable for applications that require speed over reliability and where the cost of a lost packet is minimal. It offers no acknowledgement of delivery, no flow control, no retransmission of lost packets, and no congestion control. Because it is connectionless and requires minimal overhead, it is suitable for applications such as voice and video streaming, live broadcasts and online gaming. Finally, UDP is capable of supporting multicast traffic, making it ideal for applications where multiple clients must receive the same data."
Utility Fraud,"Utility fraud is the theft of energy or utility services (gas, electricity and/or water) by tampering with meters and other equipment, abusing a payment arrangement, disconnecting service without permission or other illicit practices. Utility fraud is a major problem throughout the world that has the potential to cost millions of dollars each year. Utility fraud does not only include criminal tampering, but is also the result of incorrect billing, billing for services never received, allowing donations to be made under false pretenses, to name a few. This type of fraud is often overlooked as its cost may be hard to quantify and are often buried in the expenses of utilities. Utility fraud is difficult to detect as a variety of methods can be used to manipulate meter readings or take advantage of payments arrangements established to benefit vulnerable consumers."
Value Transfer Service,"Value Transfer Services refer to any service offered by financial institutions, non-financial businesses, or other entities that allow for the transfer of value between parties. These services may include, but are not limited to, wire transfers, money orders, check cashing, virtual currency, international money transfers, and more. These services provide a mechanism for individuals and businesses to transfer monetary value from one party to another without having to physically transport the funds. It is important to note that these services can facilitate the laundering of illicit funds, which is why Anti-Money Laundering experts take steps to ensure that these services are used appropriately and in accordance with the law."
Velocity Filters,"Velocity filtering is an anti-fraud and security technique employed to detect and block any attempted cash, credit, or debit transactions that exceed pre-programmed velocity limits. These velocity limits, or thresholds, indicate the number of times in a given period (minutes, hours, days, or weeks) that an account can be used to make legitimate (approved) purchases. If the limit is exceeded, the transaction is flagged and blocked. This prevents fraudulent merchants and hackers from using an account multiple times in a short time period and also prevents innocent customers from inadvertently exceeding their approved purchase limits. In addition, velocity filters can also help protect businesses from reputational damage due to customers overspending."
Velocity of Money,"Velocity of Money is an economic concept measuring the speed at which money passes from one party to another. It tells us how many times a unit of currency is used in a given time period. Generally, the higher the velocity of money, the better, since it means that more activities are occurring – businesses are selling more goods and services and people are earning more income. Higher velocity of money helps to propel economic growth, reducing unemployment and providing stability. It is also important for central banks to monitor the velocity of money, as it can be a useful indicator of consumer confidence and economic health. The velocity of money can also be affected by certain policies, such as quantitative easing and other monetary policies designed to increase consumer spending."
Vienna Convention,"The Vienna Convention is a multilateral treaty negotiated by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) which sets out international standards for the prevention and suppression of money laundering. It is the most comprehensive international document dealing specifically with money laundering and is intended to assist countries in implementing effective anti-money laundering measures. The Vienna Convention requires countries to have laws and regulations in place that criminalize money laundering activities and to have financial intelligence units to detect, investigate and report suspicious financial transactions. It also imposes a set of customer due diligence measures, such as customer identification and record keeping, to help prevent money laundering."
Virtual Currency,"Virtual currency is a digital asset created to act as a medium of exchange that functions similarly to traditional currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, but is not backed by any government or central banking institution. It is also not considered legal tender, and is not necessarily backed by a physical commodity. Transactions involving virtual currency can take place on peer-to-peer networks and can be used to purchase goods and services. As an Anti-Money Laundering Expert, I understand the potential risks associated with virtual currencies and their prevalence in money laundering activities. The primary risk lies in the ability to facilitate anonymous, irreversible and largely untraceable transactions, making virtual currency attractive to those engaging in illicit activities. Therefore, proper monitoring and enforcement of AML compliance measures are necessary to prevent and detect misuse."
Virtual Private Network (VPN),"A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a type of secure private network that uses tunneling protocols and encryption to provide a secure and private connection to the internet from private networks, such as those within a business, organization or home. VPNs can also be used for maintaining a secure connection over public broadband networks. VPNs provide increased security against threats such as identity theft and unauthorized access to internal networks by encrypting all data across different networks. They also enable a high degree of privacy and anonymity by obscuring an individual’s online activity from their Internet Service Provider (ISP). Furthermore, using a VPN eliminates the need for complex network management, and allows for access to services and applications that are not normally available to individuals outside of their physical location."
Virtualization Security,"Virtualization Security is the process of using a virtualized platform to provide secure access to data, applications, and networks. A virtualized platform enhances security by creating a sandboxed environment, allowing the user to securely access resources through a virtual machine, rather than directly accessing them. Virtualization Security also provides the ability to easily scale resources, allowing organizations to rapidly respond to changing demands. Additionally, virtualization security helps protect against malicious attacks, as it is nearly impossible to gain access to a physical machine. Virtualization Security is a powerful tool to protect organizations of any size from malicious attacks, allowing them to remain one step ahead of potential cyber threats."
Virus,"A virus is a piece of malicious code that exists in cyberspace and is designed to replicate and spread from computer systems to other computing systems. When a virus is introduced to a system, it copies itself and uses the host system’s resources to infect other systems. The virus can be programmed to cause a variety of different problems such as encrypting data, deleting important files, stealing data and compromising the system's security. Viruses are typically spread via email, download links, instant messaging, and even through malicious websites and infected USB drives. To prevent viruses, people should download antivirus software and regularly update it with the latest security patches, avoid clicking on suspicious emails or links, and install a firewall."
Vishing,"Vishing, also known as “voice phishing”, is a way for scammers to try to steal private information over the phone. In the scam, a scammer calls or leaves voicemails posing as a legitimate entity, such as a bank or government agency, in an attempt to collect personal information. Examples of personal information that scammers may try to gather include full names, addresses, credit card information, social security numbers etc. Scammers use many tricks to convince people to give this information. For instance, they may make urgent statements claiming that they need the information immediately, or they may threaten legal action or jail time if it isn't given. As people become more aware of the dangers involved in vishing scams, it is important that people protect themselves by not sharing important personal information with strangers. It is also a good idea to contact the actual organization in question first to make sure the call is legitimate."
Voice Authorization,"Voice Authorization is a fraud prevention process that involves verifying the identity and accuracy of a customer's payment information over the phone between the cardholder and the merchant. This is done by taking several steps to ensure the cardholder making the purchase is actually the cardholder whose name is associated with the card. This often involves asking the cardholder questions related to the billing address or other identifying information, such as to confirm the last 4 digits of their social security number. The merchant then contacts the issuing bank, typically through an automated system, to confirm that the cardholder's answers have matched the bank's records. If approved, the merchant will then complete the transaction. In the event of a mismatch, the transaction can be declined. Voice Authorization is a helpful, simple way for merchants to quickly verify payment information and reduce the risk of fraud."
Voice Firewall,"A Voice Firewall is a form of network security protection that is specifically designed to protect Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) data transmissions. The Voice Firewall is designed to detect, prevent and monitor potential threats to voice conversations. It uses a combination of hardware and software to examine each call as it goes through the network, looking for signs of malicious activity, inappropriate content, and unauthorized access. The Voice Firewall can not only detect and block malicious attackers, but it can also alert administrators to any potential risks. In addition, the Voice Firewall can also be used to enforce policies, such as quality of service, by limiting the rates and types of connections that can be made. Ultimately, the Voice Firewall provides an enhanced layer of security for VoIP networks, ensuring that your conversations remain secure and confidential."
Voice Intrusion Prevention System (IPS),"A Voice Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is an advanced security system designed to protect voice-enabled networks from malicious attacks. It uses signature- and anomaly-based detection techniques to analyze incoming voice traffic and identify known and unknown threats. IPS also employs heuristics and machine learning algorithms to detect abnormal patterns of behavior and block malicious traffic. Additionally, Voice IPS systems can be integrated with automated patching solutions to ensure that newly discovered vulnerabilities are addressed quickly and effectively, minimizing the risk of compromise. With its comprehensive suite of features, Voice IPS is an important tool for organizations to reduce the risk of network intrusion and ensure the security of their systems and valuable data."
Voice Over IP,"Voice over IP (VoIP) is a technology that enables users to make telephone calls over the internet. It is an alternative to traditional telephone lines, which can be costly and require specialized hardware. VoIP utilizes software and dedicated hardware to enable voice communication over the internet. In essence, VoIP converts analog telephone signals into digital information that can be sent over the internet and received anywhere an internet connection is available. The technology is used by businesses, organizations, and individuals to make and receive phone calls in a cost-effective and convenient manner. The most common VoIP products are Skype, Google Voice, Cisco Webex, and other internet telephony services which allow users to make and receive calls directly from a computer or a mobile device. VoIP technology is gaining popularity as businesses find it a cheaper and more flexible solution for their communication needs."
Vulnerability,"Vulnerability is an inherent flaw or weakness in a system’s security structure or architecture which can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data. They are most often found in software applications, operating systems, or hardware configurations. Vulnerabilities can be caused by design or implementation errors, inadequately tested patches or updates, and/or insufficient security controls. Vulnerabilities can manifest as security flaws, backdoor access points, incorrect system configurations, weak passwords, or other weaknesses. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, system downtime, or financial losses, making it important for organizations to continually monitor for vulnerabilities and address them in a timely manner."
Vulnerability Assessment,"A vulnerability assessment is a comprehensive review and analysis of an organizations information system and associated infrastructures to identify potential weaknesses (vulnerabilities) that could be exploited by malicious attackers. It is a core component of any successful and comprehensive cybersecurity program. Vulnerability assessment can range from a simple scan to a thorough analysis of the entire IT infrastructure. The purpose of vulnerability assessment is to not only identify vulnerabilities, but also to determine the potential impact that these vulnerabilities may have on an organization's confidential information, financial assets and reputation. It is important to have a reliable vulnerability assessment process in place so organizations can be aware of security gaps in their systems and take the appropriate steps to remediate them."
Weak Alias,"Weak alias is a form of anti-money laundering (AML) that relies on identifying customers with just an alias. This type of AML solution allows financial institutions to reduce the risk of suspicion during a transaction. Unlike strong alias, which requires full customer identification, weak alias only requires a first name and state or country of residence. This is often used in low-risk transactions, such as those with low-risk customers. By relying on only a first name and geography, the potential risk of money laundering is decreased, while still providing the institution with enough information to identify the customer and fulfill its due diligence requirements."
Web Application Firewall (WAF),"A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a security solution designed specifically to protect web applications from malicious attacks. It is placed between the web server and the Internet, analyzing incoming traffic and preventing attack attempts from reaching applications. WAFs are capable of inspecting requests from a variety of sources, such as user-input, cookies, and HTTP headers, redistributing malicious processing and blocking attacks that attempt to exploit vulnerabilities. WAFs also provide protection against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, malicious bots and crawlers, and cross-site scripting, as well as unauthorized data access, content injection, and session manipulation. In addition, WAFs can be configured to apply security policies that limit the access to an application, allowing only legitimate traffic to reach it."
Web Browser,"A web browser is an application used to access information on the Internet.

Write-Off Schemes,"Write-Off Schemes are an unlawful form of fraud in which an individual or group of individuals deliberately attempt to hide or disguise the fact that some or all of their income, debts, or asset value has been reduced or removed from the books. This is usually done to evade taxation, and sometimes involves creating transactions or documents that make it look as though the income has been lost or used. Such schemes are illegal under domestic and international law and they can have serious financial and legal repercussions. In some cases, individuals or businesses may also face criminal charges."
Zero Day,"A zero day attack is a malicious cyber attack that exploits software vulnerabilities before the patch or security updates have been released. It is considered one of the most dangerous threats to a system because the attacker may have access to an unpatched system for an extended period of time. Zero day attacks can occur in any software application, operating system, or hardware device if proper security controls are not in place. To prevent these attacks, it is important to stay up-to-date on all security updates, patching, and implementing effective security solutions. As a cybersecurity expert, it is my responsibility to stay vigilant and ensure that the necessary precautions are taken to protect against zero day attacks."
Zero-Day Attack,"A zero-day attack is a type of cyberattack for which there is no existing defense. It exploits a vulnerability in software or hardware prior to its being discovered and patched. The name comes from the fact that the developer of the software or hardware has had zero days to fix the vulnerability. The potential damage that can be caused by a zero-day attack can be serious, and they are difficult to detect and prevent. The best defense against zero-day attacks is to continuously monitor for vulnerabilities and apply patches or updates once they become available. Additionally, organizations should implement procedures that require frequent updates and security reviews of their systems and networks."
Zero-Day Exploit,"A zero-day exploit is a type of attack in which a malicious actor exploits a software vulnerability that has yet to be patched by the vendor. It is also known as a zero-day vulnerability, as the day a software vulnerability is discovered is counted from the day it is patched by the vendor. The attacker then uses the vulnerability to gain access to a system, or to execute malicious code. It can be used to take control of a system, steal data, or cause damage to hardware or software. Common zero-day threats include malware, ransomware, and other forms of malicious code. Security teams must be vigilant in identifying, patching, and mitigating zero-day threats before they can be exploited."
Zero-Touch Provisioning (ZTP),"Zero-Touch Provisioning (ZTP) is a streamlined approach to the provisioning of IT infrastructure. It automates the deployment and configuration process by using scripts or applications sent from a central server or another device within a network. ZTP eliminates the need for manual intervention, providing large-scale IT deployments with a tremendous time and cost savings. It works by either pre-loading the configuration onto a device or sending a configuration file to the device upon boot-up. This allows a device to be automatically provisioned when the system is powered on with the necessary settings and configurations already established. Removal of manual process helps to keep the entire process secure, reducing the chance of human error or malicious behavior that could lead to a security breach. ZTP also allows for quick recovery times in the event of a security breach, as the system can easily be re-configured and put back into service quickly."
